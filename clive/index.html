Hi there, I'm Clive "James" Python, although I am better known as "OwlMan". As 
a child, I had a love interest in computers, my biggest crush being the ZX 
Spectrum (that's 'zed ex' not 'zee ex'), my love for computers carried on until today.
<P><img src="https://owlman.neocities.org/clive/cool.png" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
I live in my home country of England, where the weather is surprisedly okay. 
I don't know why people like to drink tea, I think it's horrible and I bloody 
well don't know why you Yanks would want to have ice tea, blimey gov!
<P>
Apart from maintaining this site, I like to go on Discord and be a massive 
prick to my furry and weeaboo "friends". I'm not a furry or weeaboo, I don't 
own a fursuit nor do I own any Mangas.
<P>
I enjoy spending my free time on dumb subreddits like <a href="http://reddit.com/r/BritishProblems/">/r/BritishProblems/</A>, 
<a href="http://reddit.com/r/Vexillology/">/r/Vexillology/</A>, <a href="http://reddit.com/r/TotallyNotRobots/">/r/TotallyNotRobots/</A>, <a href="http://reddit.com/r/hmmm">/r/hmmm/</A>, <a href="http://reddit.com/r/BritishSuccess/">/r/BritishSuccess/</a> and other 
subreddits only creeps would like.
<P>
When I'm not fucking around on the Web, I like to shit around <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/clive/ttuc.html#Doom">playing Doom WADs</a> and 
writing crap I have the balls to call "<a href="/library/">articles</A>". The only time I'm not on my 
computer is when I'm playing my shit music, I'm quite the fan of vinyl records and <b>I have over 20!!!</b>
<P>
If you had the <i><a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/clive/ttuc.html#Honour">honour</A></i> of going on this site in 2016 you would have seen 
a lot of <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/clive/ttuc.html#Textfiles">ASCII art</A>, welp most ASCII on here is no more, if you give one shit, 
you can see what this site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170119105331/https://owlman.neocities.org/">looked like in the past</a>... if you really care that
is.
<P>
And for no reason at all, here are ten amazing facts about me!
<ol>
  <li>You better not mess with me, I know HTML and I have Notepad++ on my PC
  <li>I had a friend who went to my college who unironically made a meme Facebook page
  <li>Americans have said I have a post accent despite the fact I don't have a posh accent
  <li>I'm a big fan of David Bowie
  <li><a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/clive/ttuc.html#Fanboy">I like</A> the computer game Doom a bit too much
  <li>I was born sometime between 1980 and 2008
  <li>Clive Python is not my real name <!-- Or is it? --> <!-- No - it's not -->
  <li>I have blond hair
  <li>I really hate memes
  <li>My real name is epic_gamer_Xx
</ol>
<P>
Yeah, I'm sorry if you were looking for a serious bio or something, IDK man. 
Look, I'll try and give you a serious bio on myself now;
<P>
I tend to write about dark subjects, not because I'm an edgy 90's teen, but 
because I like learning about other humans and why they think the way they do. 
<P>
I'm a fan of most music, but I tend to play stuff pre-1990's (don't get me 
wrong, I do know that there is new good music) like David Bowie, The Beatles, 
Judas Priest, Metallica and anything that's playing on BBC Radio 6.
<P>
I would say that I'm a down to earth guy, I may seem like an edgy 90's teen at 
times, but, hey, don't we all act like an edgy 90's teen sometimes?

<P>
Anyway, must go now my fans are waiting <i>and of cause by fans, I mean people to kick my teeth in.</i> 'Appy Days!
<P>
All the best, Clive</br>
