<P>
If you had the misfortune of reading one of Clive's god-awful "<i>articles</i>" you might have read 
something you did not quite understand. It's not your fault; it's the wanker known as Clive's fault.
<P>
Because of this, we have made a nice handy guide to help you try and understand Clive's shitty work.
<P>
<a name="Words He Can't Spell">
<a href="#Words He Can't Spell"><h1>Words He Can't Spell</h1></a>
<P>
Clive is from the UK and because of this he thinks it's okay to spell words differently - 
one example of this is the odd idea that you need to add the letter "<i>U</i>" to most words.
<P>
<a name="Honour">
<a href="#Honour"><h1>Honour</h1></a>
<P>
Despite <b>THE FACT</b> that <i>honor</i> does not need the letter "U" in it, Clive barely justifies this 
obvious spelling mistake by saying it's how you spell it in British English; while this is how you spell 
it in the UK, Neocities is owned by two Americans. So Clive should spell it the correct way. The American way.
<P>
<a name="Wanker">
<a href="#Wanker"><h1>Wanker</h1></a>
<P>
If you have the bad luck of going to the UK you should scream this word out loud so everyone can hear you.
<P>
<a name="Sarcasm">
<a href="#Sarcasm">
<h1>Sarcasm</h1></a>
<P>
<i>Yeah, nothing like being cool and ironic is there?</i>
<P>Because Clive has the brain of a 
13-year-old who just got off watching Foamy the squirrel on NewGrounds.com he must have just 
found out what sarcasm is, and because of this, he will use this all the time from now on until the day he dies.
<P>
Also see <a href="#Poe's Law">Poe's law</a>.
<P>
<a name="Poe's Law">
<a href="#Poe's Law"><h1>Poe's law</h1></a>
<P>
Poe's law is an Internet adage that states that, without a clear indicator of the author's intent, 
it is impossible to create a parody of extreme views so obviously exaggerated that it cannot be 
mistaken by some readers or viewers as a sincere expression of the parodied views.

<P>
<a name="However">
<a href="#However"><h1>However</h1></a>
<P>
Clive can't stop himself from inserting the word "however" in his work - this is because he is a shitty writer and should stop writing.

<P>
<a name="Rotten Dot Com">
<a href="#Rotten Dot Com"><h1>Rotten Dot Com</h1></a>
<P>
Being that Clive was born sometime between 1980 and 2008 he has seen the soft-gore 
website known as <a href="http://rotten.com">rotten.com</a> and wow, he can click links and somehow managed to go to 
the <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/">Rotten Library</a> and <i>liked it so much</i> that he made his own library. But unlike the 
Rotten Library, the OwlMan "<i>Library</i>" is shit.
<P>
<a name="Textfiles">
<a href="#Textfiles"><h1>Textfiles</h1></a>
<P>
Want to know where it all started? Well Clive's website was a Poundland knockoff of Jason Scott's <a href="http://textfiles.com">Textfiles.com</a>. What's 
sad here is that Cive's old website was made as an archive for ASCII "art".
<a name="Fanboy">
<a href="#Fanboy"><h1>Fanboy</h1></a>
<P>
Yeah, it looks like Clive is being a fucking fanboy over X subject again. Sorry about him.
<P>
Also see <a href="#Doom">Doom</A>.
<P>
<a name="CALL THE COPS">
<a href="#CALL THE COPS"><h1>CALL THE COPS</h1></a>
<P>
Is Clive talking about a death or a killer again? Yeah, what a weird guy.
<P>
<a name="Regret/Dislikes">
<a href="#Regret/Dislikes"><h1>Regret/Dislikes</h1></a>
Clive regrets and or dislikes what he wrote in this article but keeps it online for no reason at all.
<P>
<a name="Doom">
<a href="#Doom"><h1>Doom</h1></a>
Oh good Lord is Clive talking about Doom again?
Yeah, he seems to like that game, doesn't he?
<P>
<a name="PIF">
<a href="#PIF"><h1>PIF</h1></a>
<P>
Short for "Public Information Film", a PIF is a film made in the UK to teach and inform the public about a possible danger.
<P>
Some examples of this would be "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6U9T3R3EQg">Protect and Survive</A>", 
"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pI4Ye4EZo00">King of the Road</A>", 
"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3JjyoEhCuo">Apaches</a>" etc.
<P>
PIFs are not to be confused with propaganda. PIFs and propaganda are two different things.
<P>
While the term "PIF" refers to films made in the UK they are sometimes used to talk about none-British films.
<P>
<a name="Conspiracy Theory">
<a href="#Conspiracy Theory"><h1>Conspiracy Theory</h1></a>
This article deals with that of a conspiracy theory, it is important to note 
while some theories do have some truth to them, most conspiracy theories are utter 
rubbish.
<P>
When reading an article on a conspiracy theory it is best to keep an open mind 
and think about the facts.
<P>
<a name="Tongue 'n' Cheek">
<a href="#Tongue 'n' Cheek"><h1>Tongue 'n' Cheek</h1></a>
<P>
This article is somewhat of a joke; it is most likely making fun of someone's views.
<P>
<a name="Link Rot">
<a href="#Link Rot"><h1>Link Rot</h1></a>
<P>
Link rot is a term used to describe any link that now leads to a <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/not_found.html">404 page</A>, this can be for a number of reasons;
<P>
<ul>
<li>The website was removed or is dead
<li>The owner of the site removed the page
<li>Links may be removed as a result of legal action or court order
<li>A website might change its domain name. Links pointing to the old name might then become invalid.
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot#Causes"><i>More Causes</i></A>
</ul>
<P>
Currently, the only reason why you will find a dead link on this site is because it was taken down. A lot of pages were
taken down on the <a href="/news.html#18 January 2017 @ 23:44 - SHIT YOU MADMAN!">18th of January 2017</A> due to the fact that the site
was mostly used to host third party content.
<P>
Before the pages were removed, they were manually archived in <a href="https://archive.org/web/">The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine</a>.
Sadly, some pages before the 18th of January 2017 were removed but never archived, however, they are not lost as Clive will have a backup
of them.
<P>
<a name="This Morning">
<a href="#This Morning"><h1>This Morning</h1></a>
<P>
This Morning is a British daytime television programme that is broadcasted on ITV and is hosted by Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby.
<P>
<a name="Joey Essex">
<a href="#Joey Essex"><h1>Joey Essex</h1></a>
<P>
Best know for appearing in the ITV2 television series <i>The Only Way Is Essex</i> ("TOWIE") with several of his family and friends. Essex has also
been see on "I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!", "8 Out of 10 Cats" and "Celebrity Juice".
