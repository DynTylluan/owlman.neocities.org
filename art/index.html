The knife that killed her belonged to Vicious, though he would periodically claim that he stabbed her without intent to kill, that he didn't remember the incident at all, or that Nancy fell on the knife.

He would be released on bail on the 1st of February 1979 and attended a party to celebrate his freedom.

Sid's mother (<i>Anne Beverley, can be seen behind Sid in the sketch</i>), who had been acquiring her son's drugs for years, obtained the lethal dose of heroin that left Vicious dead the following morning. He was 22. Since his death, fans as well as law enforcement officials, have theorized Spungen's murder might have been a burglary or drug deal gone wrong.

Gacy was sentenced to death on the 13th of March 1980 for 12 killings. He would spend 14 years on death row before he was executed by lethal injection at Stateville Correctional Center on the 10t of May 1994.

<td bgcolor=dddddd>Courtroom sketch of American singer-songwriter, Taylor Swift drawn by court artist Jeff Kandyba in a court case countersuit against former radio host David Mueller for alleged sexual assault and battery.
<P>
The sketch would be mocked by fans of Swift for not looking much like her. Jeff Kandyba said later that "I swear to 
God, I don't know what happened. I agree with them. My picture didn't look anything like her. When I sketched it I 
thought it did, but sometimes when you are done with the colours, and so on, the whole thing changes"
<P>
The case would lead in a victory for Swift.
