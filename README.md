Mirror made 2018-01-28.

In 2018, I uploaded a full version of my website to [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/owlman.neocities.org_10.01.2017), since then my (now old and quite frankly outdated) website has grown a lot since then, but seemly getting a full copy of it can be a pain in the arse, so for "historic" reasons, enjoy this.

I don't really think that I have all that much to say about it, I think that what I made was just okay in a lot of places, I'm not ashamed of my of my work, but I know that I could do a lot better now VS 2018 me. When looking at the website, please be aware that on this mirror I used call myself "Clive", "OwlMan", and "James" and also drop male pronouns when talking about myself, this was made during a time where I was in the early stages of denial where it comes to the terms of my own gender identity, I have since excepted the fact that I am not cisgendered and I would be open to taking HRT. I think that me giving context to why my real life name and username has since changed is important.

This was very much a personal website of mine and not talking about these things would be a discredit to myself. This is a round-about way of saying that some of the contents on this website may now be outdated, so if you do want to, say, quote something from this archive, I think that it would be smart to first fact-check and review what has been written.

Many of the webpages found in this archive have since been removed from the website itself, but I have little doubt that they have been saved via the Wayback Machine.

Oh, and also sorry for how terrible the HTML and CSS is!
