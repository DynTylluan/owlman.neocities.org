<p>TV Shows I Like<p>
<P>Here is a list of some TV shows I like and why
<p>***************************************************************************************************************<p>
</p>
<P><center>The Simpsons (1989-)
<P><img src="/14jammar/img/FkDl4ex.png">
<P>The Simpsons are America's favorite family; and I can see why.
<P>The show is about family life, the main cast being everyday people. The show has a great way of connecting to everyone.
<P>The show first came around on The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987, with great success. Being picked up by Fox TV.
<P>If you want to watch The Simpsons on UK TV, then you can do so on BBC Two

<P>Danger Mouse (1981-92)
<P><img src="/14jammar/img/AQG2Sfm.jpg">
<P>Danger Mouse was a British animated television series which was made by Cosgrove Hall Films for Thames Television.
<P>It features the cool-lookin' Danger Mouse, a British mouse who works as a secret agent. 
<P>The show is a loose parody of British spy fiction, particularly James Bond and Danger Man. 
<P>Some influence clearly also came from the Sherlock Holmes novels, as seen in references such 
<P>as the location of his post box-home (Baker Street) and his attitude to his bumbling.
<P>The show had many bad guys, like Baron Silas Greenback, LeatherHead[?] and even Count Duckula.
<P>However, the show also had good guys, like Colonel K the Walrus Head of British Secret Service, Penfold DM's bitch and Agent 57.

<P>Father Ted (1995-98)
<P><img src="/14jammar/img/TPWn5kp.jpg">
<P>Father Ted may seem like a show about a group of old priests...that's because 
<P>that's what it's about. But somehow a show about Irish priests made it to TV.
<P>The show is about Father Ted (Dermot Morgan) and his not-so-smart fellow 
<P>priest, Father Dougal McGuire (Ardal O'Hanlon) and their day-to-day life on Craggy Island.
<P>The show co-stars  Mrs. Doyle (Pauline McLynn), the housekeeper and Father Jack Hackett (Frank Kelly), the drunk.
