<p>Movies I Like<p>
<P>Here is a list of some movies I like and why I like 'em (in no order)
<p>***************************************************************************************************************<p>
</p>
<P><center>Night of the Living Dead (1968)
<P><img src="/14jammar/img/mlPCE2G.jpg">
<P>Night of the Living Dead is considered to of helped the horror franchise in America.
<P>Directed by George A. Romero this film is about a group of strangers trapped in an old house, surrounded
<P>by a large crowd of zombies. If you are going to watch any of these films, I would recommend this one, as its public domain

<P>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)
<P>Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo
<P><img src="/14jammar/img/xgkX0bs.jpg">
<P>I first saw this movie on Film 4 and I liked it at once. 
<P>I think the main reason why I liked it was because of Clint Eastwood, who played Blondie.
<P>I don't want to spoil anything, so all I will say is that's it's good

<P>Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)
<P><img src="/14jammar/img/hLYZE3E.jpg"></P>
<P>Monty Python brings us one of their best movies, and what I think, one of the best movies.
<P>The (silly) plot is as follows, King Arthur (played by the late Graham Chapman) and his knights go on
<P>a low-budget search for the Holy Grail. On their way there, they meet all sorts of funny people.
<P>The knights are met by a wizard called Tim (John Cleese), who brings them to the killer rabbit. They run away.
<P>They then need to cross a bridge by answering three questions.
<P>When they do cross it, they are met by the police, who then arrest them.

<p>The Thing (1982)
<P><img src="/14jammar/img/fmaNSCf.jpg">
<P>Oh my God, I love this movie!
<P>The Thing is about a group of scientists who are in the Antarctic and find a frozen body
<P>in a block of ice. The body turns out to be a shape-shifting alien that copies the scientists comrades
<P>By far my favorite character was Kurt Russell's R.J. MacReady. By far, one of the best things about 
<P>the movie was the aliens animation. It's really k00l

<P>Airplane! (1980)
<P><img src="/14jammar/img/2dn0J7e.jpg">
<P>Airplane! is one of Leslie Nielsen's first comedy films and for his first, it's very good.
<P>The film is about the pilots of a plain become too ill the fly the plane (that's in mid flight) so Ted - 
<P>an ex-fighter pilot from the war - decides to try and land the plane.
<P>Always have a great time watching this movie!

<P>Haxan: Witchcraft Through the Ages (1922)
<P>Heksen
<P><img src="/14jammar/img/0BNX6R0.jpg"></P>
<P>This great public domain documentary is about a woman, who is thought to be a witch.
<P>The next part of the movie shows a witch trial and how the people doing the trial tried to make the "witch" confess.
<P>By the end of the movie, it shows how witchcraft is treated in the present day (in this case 1922)
<P>***
<P>The movie was banned in the USA and heavily censored in other countries for what was considered at that time to be 
<P>graphic depictions of torture, nudity and sexual acts.
<P>However, in 1968 America, an abbreviated version of the film was released, called "Witchcraft Through the Ages". 
<P>It was narration by William S. Burroughs and had a horrible jazz score by Daniel Humair

<P><img src="/14jammar/img/dCe7Z3c.jpg"></P>
<P><i>My Neighbor Totoro</i> is Studio Ghibli's third film, made in 1988, this 
<P>movie was loved at the box office so much that in 1989 it was nominated for six 
<P>awards and won all six. It was nominated once more in 1995, but sadly lost.
<P>The plot in a nut shell is about two girls who move to a new house, they soon

<P>By the way I saw the dubbed version.
