CONTINUE FILE #666 [Recorded from a REAL BLOG OF A COLLEGE STUDUNT!!]* 
**(be fore he suidided...) 
<P>
I am college student who lives alone in a dorm and gotted Nostalgia for the 
good old days. I saw there sale was pokemon emerad on (etsy (hipster ebay) 
so I buy. When I get catridge it was emerald only BLACK with skurleton on the 
front instead of Rayquaza but with blood-eyes. 
<P>
on the file, I am in Elite 
four vs. Lance and only have 6 pokemon in my party.  They all Unknown and spell 
"YOUR DEAD" Preety suspicion," I think but probably just something in my eye??? 
The music is lavender town but backways and when I go fight He he has 666 pokemon 
too! hE sents one out and I HEAR ITS CRY. 
<P>
It turns out hte pokemon they are ALL MY DEAD GIRLFRIEND, but HYPER REALISTIC 
AND BLOODEYE. IT'S SO SCARY YOU GUYS that I throw the playstation across the room 
broke the game in half. Next day I get roommate to play. He's like 
"Ehehehehe probably IS not that scary,"
<P>
but she turned on the game and the screen was a picture of US, and but we wereDEAD, 
and the scariest part of this story is that WE was YOU and YOU BECAME SKELETON 
and WROTE this...
<P>
End.
