Endersgame Public service announcement: Nitrome made spoilers so that people who wanted to read 
spoilers could read them and that people who didn't want to read them DON'T HAVE TO!! However, 
spoilers are used instead to write random dumb messages which are fun to see what they are. If 
you actually see a spoiler when you are peeking at the messages, it RUINS THE GAME! Please, nitrome 
gamers, make spoilers be spoilers and only spoilers. Copy and paste this message onto three different 
games. Spread spoiler awareness. Thank you.
