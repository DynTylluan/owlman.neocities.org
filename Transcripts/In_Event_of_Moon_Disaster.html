About: Presidential speech writer William Safire wrote a memo to White House 
Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman suggesting how the administration might react if 
Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were stranded on the moon. 
The memo contained a draft speech intended to be read by President Richard Nixon.
********************************************************************************
Fate has ordained that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will 
stay on the moon to rest in peace.

These brave men, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin, know that there is no hope 
for their recovery. But they also know that there is hope for mankind in 
their sacrifice.

These two men are laying down their lives in mankind's most noble goal: 
the search for truth and understanding.

They will be mourned by their families and friends; they will be mourned by 
their nation; they will be mourned by the people of the world; they will be 
mourned by a Mother Earth that dared send two of her sons into the unknown.

In their exploration, they stirred the people of the world to feel as one; 
in their sacrifice, they bind more tightly the brotherhood of man.

In ancient days, men looked at stars and saw their heroes in the 
constellations. In modern times, we do much the same, but our heroes are 
epic men of flesh and blood.

Others will follow, and surely find their way home. 
Man's search will not be denied. 
But these men were the first, and they will remain the foremost in our hearts.

For every human being who looks up at the moon in the nights to come will 
know that there is some corner of another world that is forever mankind.
