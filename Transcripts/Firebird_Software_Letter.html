Dear Mr. Molyneux

Thank you for your game submission of "Fable",
but unfortunatly, we found the whole concept to
be a bit well crap.

Trees that grow by themselves over time?
Sorry but that's an outright lie,
and you know it.

We also cannot accept your game, as we sadly
do not accept submissions from
bald effiminate polo necked vampires.

However, we do wish you the best
in your future endeavours and
I'm sure some moron in the future will fall for
these ideas of yours.

Best Regards
Ivor Biggun
