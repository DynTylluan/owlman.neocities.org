Thank you!

Ten years ago today, it began with a single Tweet. Since then, every moment 
of every day, people connect live about the things they care about most - all 
over the world.

Throughout the years, you've made Twitter what it is today and you're shaping 
what it will be in the future. And for that, we thank you!
