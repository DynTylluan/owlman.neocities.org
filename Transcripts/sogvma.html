[The Court advises defendant regarding representation
by the public defendant on defendant's oral motion to fire
his assigned attorney; Friday, June 17, 2016, at 2:08
p.m. in open court:]

THE COURT: Okay. Mr.--Mr. Allen?

DEFENDANT ALLEN: Right.

THE COURT: I believe that-I believe your case is-
was going to be going to trial not this Monday but the
following Monday.
Okay. Do you understand that?

MR. ALLEN: Yes. Uh-

THE COURT: Okay. I tell you if you needed to tell
me something, I want-I'll let you come up here to the
podium so yu can speak into the microphone, and I can
hear you.

[The defendant approached the podium.]


MR. ALLEN: Yes. The atterney here, I'm wanting to
fire him

THE COURT: Uh-huh [affirmative.]

MR. ALLEN: And, you know, I don't feel like he's 
doing any-

THE COURT: Who are you going to who are you going
to hire?

MR. ALLEN: I'm not going to hire nobody. I'm going
to try to get a different public defender.

THE COURT: There isn't-you-you have a right to an
attorney.

MR. ALLEN: This lawyer has-

THE COURT: You don't have a right to a specific
attorney.

MR. ALLENL: This lawyer has made sexual advancements
on me. He-

THE COURT: Well-

MR. ALLEN: He's mis-misrepesenting my case. He
told me if-if I wanted him to do a good jb, I had to let
him give me oral sex. He's had a docrors at Central State
Hospital put a false-

THE COURT: He's had doctors at Central State 
Hospital?

MR. ALLEN: -put a false diagnosis on me.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. ALLEN: Uh-

THE COURT: I don't-you know, I know Mr. Wyatt pretty
well, and I don't think he has the ability to make doctors
at Central State do anything/

MR. ALLEN: Well, they did it, and he's the one that
had me sent down there.

THE COURT: Well, they may have done it, but I don't
think he has anything to do with it.

MR. ALLEN: All right. Well, he won't give me the
discovery.

THE COURT: He-well, I'm-

THE COURT: There's things in discovery he's supposed
to give-he gave me that indictment and told me that was
discovery.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. ALLEN -documents that I've read

THE COURT: If you-if you want-if you want the
indictment, I'll make sure you get a copy of the
indictment.

MR. ALLEN: No. I''m saying I got the indictment-

THE COURT: Uh-huh [affirmative].

MR. ALLEN: -but he's-he's not nomplying with
discovery.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. ALLEN: I'm supposed to get the autopsy report,
the coroner report, pictures of the crime scene-

THE COURT: Cor-coroner report?

MR. ALLEN: -crime background records. I want-

THE COURT: Is this a murder?

DEPUTY SHERIFF: In the county jail.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. ALLEN: Yeah. I supposed to get criminal
background records, investigational summaries.

THE COURT: Mr. Wyatt, what discovery do you have?

MR. WYATT: I've given him everything I have.

THE COURT: You've given him everything you have?

MR. WYATT: Yes, sir.

THE COURT: He's given you everything-

MR. ALLEN: This is a murder case, and you're-

THE COURT: Huh?

MR. ALLEN: This is a murder case, and you're telling
me the only thing on discovery is a four-page indictment.

THE COURT: I don't think he's saying that. I think
he said he's given you everything that he has.

MR. ALLEN:  He ain't give mo the autopsy report.
He ain't given mo the coroner's report. He ain't given me-

THE COURT: Well, it may be that he doesn't have 
that. I don't know.

MR. ALLEN: That's what I've been trying to get.
He didn't give me pictures of the crime scene. I've seen
other people go to trial on-on murder carges. I've seen
what you're supposed to get. I'm not going to work with this attorney.

THE COURT: Well, you know, you-you-

MR. ALLEN: It's not-it's not going to happen.

THE COURT: You've got-you've got-

MR. ALLEN: I'm not going to trial with this
attorney.

THE COURT: Well, you've got two choices. One, you
can go to trial with him, or, two, you can try this case
yourself.
Now, I definitely, completely think that that's-

MR. ALLEN: I've got a right t have-

THE COURT: Wait a minute. Listen to me. That would
be the biggest mistake you've ever made in your life.

MR. ALLEN: So basically you're sitting here telling
me-

THE COURT: Now, yu have a-

MR. ALLEN: -you're going to find me guilly if I-if
I go to trial and try to defend myself?

THE COURT: You're probably right. That would be my
guess if you try to defend yourself.
You-you don't know anything about selecting a jury,
do you?

MR. ALLEN: No.

THE COURT: Do you know anything about cross-
examining witnesses?

MR. ALLEN: No.

THE COURT: Do you know anything about criminal
procedure?

MR. ALLEN: I know I don't have to let-

THE COURT: Do you know anything-I'm

MR. ALLEN: -this guy suck my dick-

THE COURT: Let-let-let me-let me-let-

MR. ALLEN: -to get some legal representarion.

THE COURT: You know something, I'll be honest, Mr.
Allen, I really don't belive that.

MR. ALLEN: I'm not-I'm not concerned if you belivev
it or not.

THE COURT: I-you know, I-

MR. ALLEN: But I'm-I'm supposed to-I'm supposed to
have a right to get a attorney-

THE COURT: That-

MR. ALLEN: -and I'm not going to work with this
attorey.

THE COURT: Well, that's up to you.

MR. ALLEN: So I hold myself in contempt if you try
to pull me up here to court with the attorney.

THE COURT: That-that's fine. I mean, that's up to
you. You-I told you what your choices are. You can go
to trial-

MR. ALLEN: I'm-I'm just telling you. Well-

THE COURT: Listen to me.

MR. ALLEN: Fuck you.

THE COURT: Listen to me.

MR. ALLEN: Go fuck yourself.
I'm through here, Are y'all done?

THE COURT: I-I am finding-I'm finding you in
contenpt of Court.

MR. ALLEN: I don't care.

THE COURT: I know you don't. And I'm sentence you to 
twenty days for that. And if you say anything else, I'm 
going to add twenty days for everything you say.

MR. ALLEN: Fuck you.
