    Why do you feel the need to post on 4chan? Lol. You should be banging female models and snorting coke off their tits.

    OP here

    You have to suck off a few cocks to get through the glass ceiling, but once you prove yourself they leave you alone.

    6ft 2" minimum is probably 6ft for runway/high fashion but any height is fine for other stuff
    >>648413708
    I quit drugs last year. Most female models are extremely stuck up and it's almost like the industry soils them. Most of them have no sex appeal.
    >>648413760
    Why? I'm not exactly proud of what I do, but fuck it.
    >>648414072
    Never sucked a dick. The gayest thing I ever did was kinda flirt with this designer to get him to like me. That was kinda funny he probably knew I'm straight.

    I didn't finish the last two years cos my mental health was pretty bad, I didn't leave the house for the most part of a year.
    >>648414783
    I used to do about half a gram a week, not as much as some as the other dudes but they're fucked now. I don't smoke but sometimes they want us to smoke for shoots. It makes me kinda sick.
    >>648414989
    7, and that's over a 3 year period. I've given up on female models.

    I've got a lot saved and I still am saving so it feels all right. I'll probably become a carpenter when this ends.

    I was on vacation in Manhattan. This "talent" scout came up to me and straight up offered me to go to the studio he works for that weekend. I was very lucky.
    Most agencies are decent. The Italian ones are the worst though. Italy is probably the worst place for a model imo.

    Well I'm with Elite models here in NYC, that's how I know Adrianna, but yeah Elite NYC and Elite Milan are COMPLETELY different. NYC is bad compared to LA but it's great compared to Milan. Everyone over there is rude, pretentious, just not easy to work with. They think they're better than everybody else.

    I had no experience, I was pretty shy in school. Yeah they do help, it's not that hard to catch on, unless you're really retarded. They can be kinda dicky though.
    >>648420051
    Depends. What was the reason you turned them down?
