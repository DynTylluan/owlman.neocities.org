Dear Mike,
The Censor's representative, Tony Kerpel, came along to Friday's
screening at Twickenham and he gave us his opinion of the film's
probable certificate.

He thinks the film will be AA, but it would be possible, given
some dialogue cuts, to make the film an A rating, which would
increase the audience. (AA is 14 and over, and A is 5 - 14).

For an '<U>A</U>' we would have to:
	Lose as many <U>shits</U> as possible
	Take <U>Jesus Christ</U> out, if possible
	Lose "I fart in your general direction"
	Lose "the <U>oral sex</U>"
	Lose "oh, fuck off"
	Lose "We make castanets out of your testicles"

I would like to get back to the Censor and agree to lose the
<U>shits</U>, take the odd <U>Jesus Christ</U> out and lose <U>Oh fuck off</U>, but
to retain 'fart in your general direction', 'castanets out of your 
testicles' and 'oral sex' and ask him for an 'A' rating on
that basis.

Please let me know as soon as possible your attitude to this.

Yours sincerely,

<U>Mark Forstater</U>
