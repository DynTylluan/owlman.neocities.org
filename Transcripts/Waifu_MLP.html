Apple horse wouldn't quite understand exactly why I was going to college, instead of doing manual labour like God intended, but I'm sure she'd be happy I'm at least working hard at my intellectual job and studying for another one. That and I have a healthy social life.

she probably wouldn't understand why I have so much porn of her, though.

She's probably be fine with playing video games and tabletop games together and taking long walks.

I'm certain that the moment I'm aware of her existence I would change my lifestyle to suit her, but if she made these observations without my knowledge she would probably be willing me to be more active and outdoorsy.

Thank you, Anon. Your kindness is appreciated. I know you're right, of course. But it's such a long time to suffer, and there is so much wrong with this world. 

But she didn't give up. Not once. Not when she and Celestia had their falling out, not when Twilight came to get her crown, not when the other students refused to believe she'd changed, not when the Dazzlings, or the Shadowbolts, or the..... Well, too many to name, especially when you consider all of her adventures that haven't made it to the screen. She NEVER gave up.

I'll try to be like her, my shining light in the dark void of this hell. In the end we'll find each other, and happiness. I know it.

May you find happiness too, Anon.

She'd probably tell me to get off my ass and do something for my self and to stop sulking around, telling myself that not talented, even though im not. Or at least dick around in sports with her. I wouldn't mind picking up b-ball again, I'd be incredibly rusty though. Even though after highschool tryouts, freshman year, crushed my dreams and made me drop basketball forvever
