<a name="whatisgoingonnow"></a>>WHAT IS GOING ON NOW?

First off, hello, second off, sorry. I'm English
don't you know?

So... what is going on here, eh? To answer my own 
question, this is a way to change things up a bit,
there is no mail list - thank God - that you can
join. Even if you could join a list, why would
you? Only three people would join the mail list!

-------------------------------------------------

<a name="ukpolitics"></a>>UK POLITICS

My good mate, Chunky, told me this joke the other
day; "What's the difference between my penis and
parliament? Parliament is hung." - Thanks for that
one, mate. He doesn't even know about this
website, lul.

So the UK "just" voted on who they want to rule
their shit little island, annnd it's a
Conservative victory with Labour in second. Now,
unlike in the USA, we don't riot about not
winning the General Election, I don't know why
maybe it's because we're not babies who get killed
by guns all of the time.

Nothing is going to change really, the only new
thing is that there are more Labour members in 
parliament, so Jeremy Corbyn better do his best!

One of the best things that happened in the
General Election is that UKIP got FuCkInG
KiLlEd, not only did they get zero seats in
parliament, but Paul Nuttall resigned! GET 
WRECKED!

This was also the first time that I was legally
allowed to vote in the General Election, and
damn, I voted so hard that I popped a blood 
vessel and nearly broke a rib. I'll let you guess
who I voted for.

-------------------------------------------------

<a name="asciiofthenow"></a>>ASCII OF THE NOW

If I manage not to hang myself, I'll try and do a
thing where I pick "ASCII of The Now" - AKA ASCII 
that I quite like.
This weeks winner is everyone in the UK! Only
joking, no-one wins anything if they live in this
shithole.

As of late, I've found out about this 80's band
called 'Warlock', they sound quite good they do.
While playing their album "Burning The Witches"
I feel like it is one of the most 80's things ever,
I don't know what the lead singer looks like, but
I imagine that she has big blond Jewfro, while
she is dressed in pink and blue with neon colours
in the background.

<a name="fanmail"></a>>FAN MAIL

Today's fan mail comes from fellow Neocities user
Kratzen, who writes;

"if you misrepesent furries i'll file a thousand 
DMCA notices against your site"

Why thank you for your nice words! If you want to
send me some more nice words, you can contact me
with the E-Mail address at the top, or if you use
Neocities, you may write on my wall at this URL;
<a href="https://neocities.org/site/owlman">https://neocities.org/site/owlman</a>

<a name="untilnexttime"></a>>UNTIL NEXT TIME

Go away.

Oh, also, this may be a one-off thing, or I might
stick with it. I'm really not sure, but hey, we all
die in the end, don't we.

One of the down-sides of using this style is that I
can't use photos, that might be a pain in the arse
later. I don't know.

Right now I'm working on a new article (Holy shit)
that is about the Monalisa Perez and Pedro Ruiz
YouTube gun stunt thing. Hopfuly it will be out by
Monday. But if you know me, it will be out in 2036.

I really need to write more shit and put it on this
website.

Oh well!

In other news, I'm now a free man, my life is no
longer full of shit to do, I can spend all of my 
free time on the Web, wanking to yiff while
playing Doom on the easiest setting at the same
time I drink Pepsi from Poundland anytime I like!

Amazing!

Because of this, it means that I can write more
shit articles to spam Neocities with. Or I might
just wank more. We'll see.

Love you all!

P.S.

Never stop doing what you love, never.
