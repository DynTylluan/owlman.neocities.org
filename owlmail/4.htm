<a name="welcome"></a>>WELCOME

Welcome one and all to the fourth OwlMail thing.
If you don't know what OwlMail is, I would highly
recommend that you now press CTRL + W to save your
worries.

For people who are unlucky enough to know what this
train wreck is, welcome back, again, sorry.

Today, in this issue, we will be looking at the
late George A. Romero, Baby Driver, and a slice of
pixie dick on the side. So tuck in!

-------------------------------------------------

<a name="georgearomero"></a>>GEORGE A. ROMERO

Zombies are not a new concept, they have been
around for 100s of years, infact, the word "zombie"
is was first recorded in the 1819 book - _History
of Brazil_ by poet Robert Southey.

In 1932, Victor Halperin directed White Zombie, a
horror film starring Bela Lugosi. In this
movie, the zombies are more seen as slaves rather
than the flesh-eating monsters we think of today.

We very much have cult film maker George A. Romero
to thank for the creation of the modern-day zombie.
Night of The Living Dead is strongly considered to
be the birth of the modern day zombies. The movie
centres around a group of survivors who are forced
to make do in an abandoned house. While I won't
spoil any of the plot to you.

I will say that one of the main characters, Ben
(played by Duane Jones) is a black man, while
casting a non-white person in a movie today is
not seen as a big thing, you must
remember that this movie was being made at the same
time as the African-American Civil Rights Movement
was in full swing. I personally think that Ben is
the best character, just because he is one of the
only level-headed people in the movie.
 
While I like the male characters, the female
characters are just poorly written, Barbara, for
example, is just a crap character, whose main job
seems to be running away from things, crying and
getting in the way. I like a good heroin as the next
person, but Barbara is just shite.

To be fair to the movie, Barbara has a very small
roll in the grand scheme of things, but still, she
does annoy me.

I am writing this as the director of Night of The
Living Dead, has sadly passed away at age 77.

Quoting The Los Angeles Times

Romero died Sunday in his sleep after a "brief but
aggressive battle with lung cancer," according to a
statement to The Times provided by his longtime
producing partner, Peter Grunwald. Romero died
while listening to the score of one his favorite
films, 1952â€™s "The Quiet Man," with his wife,
Suzanne Desrocher Romero, and daughter, Tina
Romero, at his side, the family said.

<a name="babydriverreview"></a>>BABY DRIVER REVIEW

In issue two of OwlMail I talked about what I
thought about the trailer of Baby Driver, and to be
honest, I was unsure about what the movie was going
to be like, I hadn't seen any reviews and I didn't
even watch the Your Movie Sucks' review of the
film.

After going to the pictures on the 20th of July, I
am happy to report that Edgar Wright has once
again, made a classic!

Spoilers I guess...

The Good:
>The soundtrack kicks arse on a whole new level

>The main character is very likeable

>The action sceans are really cool (and gave me a
boner) especially the one at the start

>cars r kewl B-)

>The lyrics of some of the songs can be seen
written on street objects

>Samm (Brogan Hall) wasn't annoying

>Queen

The Bad:
>Some of the music was hard to hear, especially the
Queen tracks

>My Gran didn't know what Jamie Foxx was saying

>That's about it

Go see the movie, I guess. I want to watch Scott
Pilgrim vs. the World now...

<a name="asciiofthenow"></a>>ASCII OF THE NOW

ASCII of The Now is a weekly thing that I do where
I show you the best ASCII art that I've found on
the Web. Oh boy, this week is great!

The winner of this week are three people; Krogg
(Krogg Zothommog), VK (Veronica Karlsson) and ejm
(llizard) who bring us our first collaboration and
it's a pixie taking a piss. Nice one, lads.

It would seem that the pixie's slong is not only
erect but also very big, for Christ's sake, it's as
big as his arm!

Smoke me a kipper, don't you just love one hit
wonders? Well, here's a famous one here. When MTV
started in 1981 the first music video to play was
suitably Video Killed The Radio Star by The
Buggles. MTV was not only a whole new eara for
television but was a whole new playing ground for
music as a whole.

To be honest with you right now, I have no idea
what to write here.

Just watch this video. Okay? Okay.

<a name="fanmail"></a>>FAN MAIL

Boy oh boy, aren't I famous?

_No_

Oh... Well, here is some "fan" mail from Design Choices who wrote on Discord...

With all of the cool (and somewhat questionable)
information in OwlMail, it's almost impossible to
figure out why people [...] read it.

When this was written, there were only two OwlMail
letters published, Christ, you need to read
OwlMail III for more somewhat questionable
information!

Anyway, thank you Design Choices for your kind
words and for feeding my ego.

LoOk At His WeBsItE!

<a name="untilnexttime"></a>>UNTIL NEXT TIME

DiE NoW

Next weeks OwlMail may be late or some rubbish, as
I intend to write a (shite) article on furries
because I can.

As of late, furries and this site seem to be an
ongoing joke, I'm not sure why. Hell - why am I
even complaining? I'm the one who put the gasoline
on the fire - well, petrol - so it's all my fault!

If you wish to help me write the furry article,
