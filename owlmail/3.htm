<a name="welcome"></a>>WELCOME

[Before reading OwlMail III, note that a lot of it
was written before Spriteclad wrote their fairwell
from Neocities letter and it is not intentional
that some of the things Spriteclad wrote about
bleeds through.]

Welcome to the third and hopefully the last of this
really, really bad newsletter; this week, we'll be
looking at Weird Al, if I'm a furry or not, an old
DOS AI and much more!

You know, I was thinking that the Fan Mail part of
the newsletter sounds a little smug, like I have a
big ego or something, it's not like I have that
many fans at all really and I don't want to portray
myself as someone who is overly smug, so I was
thinking of renaming it to something like "Hate
Mail" or something like that. What do you think?

I'm not quite sure.

-------------------------------------------------

<a name="drs"></a>>DR. SBAITSO

Over this past week, I've been messing around with
old computer games from the 90's via DOSBox and as
of late I've had some fun with Dr. SBAITSO v2.20, a
computer _AI_ from 1992, with the aim of faking
intelligence.

Just like Dr. Shipman, I wouldn't trust Dr. Sbaitso
with anything

The program claims that the AI can do basic maths,
but I've yet to see Dr. Sbaitso successfully
recognise my input as a maths question. This 
ranscript is from a real conversation I had with
him, trying to get him to do basic maths.

OWLMAN: 6+2
DR: I'M LOST, COULD YOU PLEASE SUPPLY MOREDETAILS

OWLMAN: 6 ADD 2
DR: HOW ABOUT ASKING ME ABOUT MATHEMATICS INSTEAD?

Really? Okay, so admittedly as it turns out, to
make Dr. Sbaitso do maths you type
in "CALC [question]", but still...

Trying to break the AI is also fun to do. Try
typing in a rude word or break the AI by asking a
very long maths question!

Most of the fun in the program comes in seeing what
weird shit Dr. Sbaitso responds with, honestly,
it's surreal at times.

I feel like using the term "AI" is wrong, as Dr.
Sbaitso never learns from interacting with another
human. Overall, the program feels only half made,
the majority of conversations with Dr. Sbaitso
feel very one sided and a bit crap at times.

I wrote down the transcript of me trying to test
the Turing test on the AI. How I failed... you can
read the whole transcript with the URL below this
text...

Also, there's this..?

OWLMAN: HOW OLD ARE YOU?
DR: PERHAPS IN YOUR FANTASIES ?

What does this M E A N? Is the AI speaking in spy
code or something?

-------------------------------------------------

<a name="amiafurry"></a>>AM I A FURRY?!?!

For some reason, people think that I'm a furry.
Jesus, you can't own over 3.39 GB (3,640,979,456
bytes) of yiff without being called a furry today,
can you?

YIFF IN H*CK!

About 3 months ago I asked on my profile this;

owlman: Does "OwlMan" sound like a furry name?

yupthatsme: Yes.

arkmsworld: Er...no...no! .....Why do you ask? :O

10kb: i'm a furry and i will tell you that there is
no difference between calling yourself "owlman" and
a marketer for breakfast cereal calling their
mascot "tony the tiger." real furries have names
like dwaggy and kato.

strata: nah

melonking: No more than melonking sounds like a
budget boob salesman ;-D

sO aM i A fUrRy Or NoT?

Guys, help me out here!

<a name="asciiofthenow"></a>>ASCII OF THE NOW

ASCII of The Now is a weekly thing that I do where
I show you the best ASCII art that I've found on
the Web. This is ASCII, not ANSI, not pixel art,
but ASCII!

The winner of this week is Joan G. Stark AKA jgs,
who made this very touching homage to their
Computer Angel who looks over us all when we're on
our computers. Amen, Joan, amen!

One of the most underrated musicians of the 20th
and 21st century would probably be Weird Al, for
some reason he is only really known as "that guy
who did 'White and Nerdy'", that is to say, not
only ignoring more than forty decades of comedy
gold, but also dissing the man at the same time.

I've never really had the chance to confess my love
for Al, so let me say it now; Weird Al is not only
a great singer, but he is an amazing human who
brings happiness to billions of people around the
world.

Throughout Weird Al's career, he has been able to
stay a head of the game even when his own personal
life is in Hell.

Let me explain what I mean by this - in 2004, Weird
Al was on tour when news that his mother and father
had died in of carbon monoxide poisoning in their
own home. Weird Al had no brothers or sisters, so
in one extremely tragic event, he had lost all of
his close family. Instead of cancelling the rest of
the tour, he went on stage and performed on the
same night.

To quote Al himself;

"Many people have wondered what's going to happen
with the tour. I briefly considered cancelling some
shows but I ultimately decided that it would be
better for me personally to continue working.

Plus, I've heard from so many people over the years
that my music has cheered them up in times of
tragedy, well I thought that maybe my music would
help me too.

So far, it has. Going up on stage in front of
thousands of supportive fans is a cathartic and
somewhat therapeutic experience for me right now.
I don't know if I can say that the concerts really
take my mind off the tragedy, but at least they
give me a break from sobbing all the time"

If that doesn't show you how brave Al is, I don't
know what to tell you.

<a name="fanmail"></a>>FAN MAIL

This week's _fan_ mail comes from Spriteclad (AKA
98plus) who writes on their farewell from Neocities
letter...

[...] Also, I'm not going to say who they are, but
there's one person that has just... really bugged
me on there. We haven't interacted much or
anything, but they way they type with this aire of
edginess and egotistical "people are stupid and I'm
going to use the most edgy language without using
slurs" vibe. I just... sigh. It's a shame, because
the sites they've made have good ideas attached to
them, but the execution is... less than stellar.
That's all I'm going to say. [...]

To read the full text, follow the link below...
<a href="https://spriteclad.com/blog.html">https://spriteclad.com/blog.html</a>

Now, are they talking about me? I've made a lot of
Neocities sites over the years and I guess I've
used edgy language without using slurs, but to
quote my bio "I may seem like an edgy 90's teen at
times, but, hey, don't we all act like an edgy
90's teen sometimes?"

But what gets me is the ego part, I never thort
myself to have that big of an ego.

Or I might just be overthinking this.

I don't know, man, I wish them the best, I have
nothing personal against them at all and I honestly
hope that Spriteclad goes onto bigger and brighter
things.

-------------------------------------------------

<a name="untilnexttime"></a>>UNTIL NEXT TIME

God, I don't know. Don't look a dog in his eyes or
he'll go mad. Don't drink and drive and smoking
kills.

Good, now that I got that out of the way, I'd just
like to say thank you for reading my third OwlMail
post thing. You know, I'm writing this ahead of
time; in fact, as I write this, the date is
11/07/17, so cool I guess.

I honestly find it weird when I see how many people
follow and view my site. Like just this month, I've
had the most views I've ever had and I'd just like
to thank you, the viewer and everyone on Neocities!
