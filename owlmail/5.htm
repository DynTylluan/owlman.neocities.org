<a name="welcome"></a>>WELCOME

Welcome to the forth, no, fith, OwlMail issue; this
week we shell look at more or less of the same crap
as ever...

-------------------------------------------------

<a name="imill"></a>>I'M ILL

So, what has been going on since my last post? 

Not much really, I'm just posting this to say that
I'm sick, oh boy! I went and saw my local GP this
week (Save the NHS!) to see what was wrong with me
and as it turns out, I have tonsillitis (that is to
say an oral infection of a sort), so I'm taking
paracetamol like, four times a day, so cool cool!
All I've been able to drink is Coca-Cola, like,
thank God for Capitalism. I'm sounding like an
american again, aren't I?

One upside of being sick is that I was able to
watch (for the first time) Black Books, a black
comedy by the same guy who made Father Ted and I
must say that the show was really surreal but in a
good way. Much like a lot of British comedies, the
show had only a handful of episodes, six in total,
which is a shame in a way.

I know that there is the saying "would you rather
have a show be axed before its time, or carry on
until it's bad?". Now, I'm not so sure if the idea
of being "axed before its time" applies to comedies
in a way, like, a lot of comady TV shows have a
long life, such as Dad's Army, Red Dwarf, Only
Fools and Horses, and other ones I can't be
bothered to list.

Well done to Axel Poque AKA apx for being the fifth

Have you ever played an album and you were just
blown away at how flawless it is? Candlemass' 1987
album Nightfall did just that, while I'm not the
biggest fan of doom music, Candlemass have really
struck a chord with me, their music is very
powerful, almost religious like at times. I
suppose saying that quite a lot of heavy metal
songs have religious sounding lyrics to them, such
as Metallica's For Whom The Bell Tolls. But with
Candlemass I feel like you could be mistaken that
they're quoting from The Bible.

"One day I saw a man dressed in rags, with a staff
in his hand begging for a penny to survive How
poor a man can be I gave him hospitality a room, a
bed and lots of food to eat

Still I hear his last few words 'I can never return
what you've done but heaven will remember and
repay' Fifty years had gone since I saw him I was
dying and I'd soon be dead Three angels stood in
front of my bed

The first one she said to me, don't be afraid I
will give you immortality, and grace for your soul
The second had eyes of gold, she gave me my wings
The third gave all wisdom, an angel could give
...to me

One day I saw a man dressed in rags, with a staff
in his hand begging for a penny to survive How poor
a man can be I gave him hospitality a room, a bed
and lots of food to eat

I joined with my destiny, eternally I knew I was
born again, an angel to be A vision beyond my
dreams, called me by name So in devotion I spread
my wings, to heaven I had came
...to stay"

That's it. Yeah, sorry this issue was shorter 
than my penis but as I said, I'm ill.
