T.H.E. Fox<font size="4">
<a href="http://cbmfiles.com/genie/TheFoxListing.php"><img src="/comic/THEFOX.png"></a>
<i>T.H.E. Fox</i> is one of the earliest webcomics online, starting in 1986 and running to '88.
The comic was published on CompuServe, Q-Link and GEnie, it was soon published on the web.

<font size="5">Cyanide & Happiness<font size="4">
<a href="http://explosm.net"><img src="/comic/CH.png"></a><!-- The comic can be found here http://explosm.net/comics/4284/ --!>
Is one of the funniest webcomic I have found, all of their comics have made me laugh, plus, their 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ExplosmEntertainment" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> is great! What's more is that they bring out a new comic every day.

<font size="5">Let's Speak English<font size="4">
<a href="http://www.marycagle.com/"><img src="/comic/LSE.png"></a><!-- The comic can be found here http://www.marycagle.com/letsspeakenglish/80-appropriation --!>
This comic is about the time Mary Cagle (the one who made LSE) was in Japan as an English Teacher.
One thing to note is that there is some continuity and running jokes.

<font size="5">Extra Fabulous Comics<font size="4">
<a href="http://extrafabulouscomics.com"><img src="/comic/EFC.png"></a><!-- The comic can be found here http://extrafabulouscomics.com/comic/154/ --!>
Is a great comic to read, as it can be very funny. Much like Cyanide & Happiness there can be some 
off-colour jokes (not saying that's a bad thing), however, most of the comics are light hearted.

<font size="5">Jim'll Paint It<font size="4">
<a href="https://twitter.com/jimllpaintit"><img src="/comic/JWPI.png"></a><!-- The Queen can be found here https://twitter.com/Jimllpaintit/status/723200840803094528/photo/1 --!>
Not *really* a comic, but, Jim always makes very funny MS Paint art that is always looks awesome. I can't 
really put into words how cool his work is.

<font size="5">Owl Turd Comix<font size="4">
<a href="http://owlturd.com/"><img src="/comic/owlturd.png"></a><!-- The comic can be found here http://imgur.com/gjIbIiv --!>
A comic about how life is veddy odd some times and how bad it can get

<font size="5">Benji Nate<font size="4">
<a href="https://t.co/lX2EawDV8y"><img src="/comic/lorna.png"></a><!-- http://girlbenji.neocities.org/lorna/lorna006.html --!>
I love her comics, there so cool, I liked to read the comic <a href="http://girlbenji.neocities.org/lorna.html">Lorna</a>, it's about a girl who
is trying to go on a date with a boy, but it does not go so well.
Benji Nate also has some more comics like Bad End, Rat Girl, Lights in The Sky, Void Boy and Misc
