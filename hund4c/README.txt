Hello there fans of retro games or even first time players!

This is a mod of the granddaddy FPS game, Wolfenstein 3D, where I have removed all of the Nazi refrences. I did this so people in Germany can known full well that
the game they are playing will (hopfuly) be okay with their goverment.

I percaly think that banning Nazi imarary in all but art, science, research, teaching is a bit over the top, as computer games such as Wolf 3D would be banned
in Germany, but that's just me.

--Short list of things I removed/edatid--
-Removed the Nazi nasnal althum with that of the Welsh one
-Updated the title care to say "Hundefelsen 4C"
-Updated the flag pole on

Have a nice day, Clive "James" Python
