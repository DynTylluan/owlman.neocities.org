Christine Chubbuck was born on the 24th of August 1944 in Hudson, Ohio. She was 
the daughter of Margaretha D. "Peg" (1921-1994) and George Fairbanks Chubbuck 
(1918-2015). She had two brothers, Greg and Tim. Chubbuck attended the Laurel 
School for Girls in Shaker Heights, a suburb of Cleveland.
<P>
She originally worked at WXLT-TV (now WWSB) as an evening news reporter and 
then later she went on to host a morning community affairs talk show, Suncoast Digest.<img src="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/chubbuck.png" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
<P>
In the lead-up to her death, she had volunteered to make a feature on suicide 
for the station, for her research on the subject, she had asked a bobby who the 
best way of taking your own life was (the sheriff told her what kind of gun and 
bullets that he would use if ever put in that situation).
<P>
On the 15th of July 1974, 29-year-old Christine had come, equipped with a gun, to 
end it all. Chubbuck (who was noticeably more enthusiastic and cheerful than usual) 
declared, just before Suncoast Digest was due to go on air, that she needed to read 
a newscast beforehand, confusing co-workers (as this was something she had never 
done before).
<P>
Everything went fine for eight minutes, she covered three national stories. When 
she got to the fourth story, a shooting at a local restaurant, the reel for the 
footage jammed, prompting her to shrug, nonchalantly turn towards the camera and 
proclaim the now infamous line;
<P>
<tt><blockquote>In keeping with the WXLT practice of presenting the most immediate and complete reports of local blood and guts news, TV 40 presents what is believed to be a television first. In living colour, an exclusive coverage of an attempted suicide</tt></blockquote>
<P>
She then drew a revolver that she had hidden in her bag, placed it behind her 
right ear and fired, immediately slumping forward violently onto her desk, as the 
technical director scrambled to fade rapidly to black.
<P>
<h1>The Footage</h1>
<P>
This was 1974, not <script type="text/javascript">var year = new Date();document.write(year.getFullYear());</script> where 
everything is recorded, only rich or lucky people could afford a video cassette recorder in the 70's, it is possible that someone 
recorded the suicide, but it is unlikely. If someone did record the suicide, it is likely that the video is now damaged 
because of time, or the owner does not want to release the tape.
<P>
A significant number of people have claimed to have seen the footage via a number of 
sources other than the original live broadcast, including early websites (nope), FBI 
training videos (nope), and mondo films a la Faces of Death (nope), this seems unlikely 
as to why did no one archive the video.
<P>
One of the most likely people to have a copy of the video will be WXLT-TV and as it 
seems, they do indeed have a copy. According to an article published by Vulture, 
Mollie Nelson, the widow of the owner of Chubbuck's news station, has a copy, the article says that;
<P>
<tt><blockquote>
[Vulture] got a call that confirms the tape's existence. [...] [Mollie Nelson] 
called us [...] to explain that she had the video for years - her late husband 
Robert Nelson had kept a copy of the tape, though Mollie says he never told her why.
</tt></blockquote>
<P>
The article continues by saying after the Sundance debut of "<i>Kate Plays 
Christine</i>" in which a former news station employee suggests that Nelson 
might have the tape, people started contacting her, all the attempts made her 
uncomfortable, she gave the tape to an unnamed "very large law firm"
<P>
The article ends by telling us that Mollie Nelson has no plans to release the tape.
<P>
<h1>The Footage has Been Found?</h1>
<P>
No - the footage has not been found. In 2017 there was a video published 
by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NationSquid">NationSquid</a> that <i>showed</i> the on-air suicide. 
The video, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8agGtFmAJFQ">Freaky 5 - Lost Footage</a>" (7:28), seems to show Chubbuck killing 
herself, many people, <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/w3/chubbuckarchive.html">including myself</a>, were unsure if the footage was 
legit. I can safely say that it is most likely fake.
<P>
Many people online have picked the footage apart, one big tell tail is the 
lettering on the desk. itwbtc16 on NationSquid forum said this about it;
<P><tt><blockquote>
The biggest standout inconsistencies for me in terms of visuals lie in the 
'NEWSWATCH' sign which we see on the front of the desk. Whilst the font is 
pretty spot on, there are some very minor inaccuracies.
<P>
As we can see in the crime scene photo, there is a sun-like circle which is 
placed behind the 'N' right at the start of the word. However, straight off 
the bat, if we look at the exact placement of the 'N' in relation to the 
circle, we see that in the crime scene photo, the 'N' is located more towards 
the top-right of the circle, leaving more of the circle visible beneath the 
'N' than above it, whereas in the footage, the 'N' appears to aligned perfectly 
central with the circle, with an equal amount of the circle visible both above 
the 'N' and beneath it. The circle itself also appears to be ever so slightly 
larger in the footage than in the crime scene photo.</tt></blockquote>

Meanwhile, on the Lost Media Wiki, user dycaite <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170214215627/http://lostmediawiki.com/Home">posted on the notice board</a> this message about the footage;
<tt><blockquote><P>
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8z8UBb1QX1s?" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
<P>
<p>Hey guys, dycaite here.
</p><p>So, as a lot of you are probably aware (from either the forums, the shoutbox or the Discord), 
there has been a lot of buzz recently about a supposed leak of the 
<a href="http://lostmediawiki.com/The_Christine_Chubbuck_Tape_(Lost_On-Air_Suicide_Footage;_1974)">Christine Chubbuck tape</a> that turned up in a Top 5 video on YouTube (the video in question <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8agGtFmAJFQ">can be found here</a>). I avoided reporting on this in any official manner until such a time as some concrete proof of either its legitimacy or, more likely, it's illegitimacy had come to light (unlike <i>some</i> so-called "news" outlets, who practically touted it as hard fact), but I can now confirm that the clip is indeed a fake, nothing more than a well done re-enactment.
</p><p>The clip was confirmed fake a couple of days back by Gordon Galbraith, news director of WXLT at the time, who posted a Facebook message outlining the reasons for the tape being fake, a screenshot of which <a  href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170214220126/http://i.imgur.com/FToXkc5.png">can be found here</a>.
</p><p>Randy has also done a short V-Log on the tape and its newly proven illegitimacy, which can be seen above.
</p><p>So, that's that; case closed. This leaves us with the conclusion that the clip was faked purely for publicity reasons and while I don't necessarily want to incite condemnation of NationSquid, I think most of you would agree that it's a pretty unsavoury thing to have done; here's hoping he finally does the right thing and comes clean about it now instead of carrying on the charade.
</p><p>Take it easy guys.
</tt></blockquote>
<P>
So yeah, it's fake.
