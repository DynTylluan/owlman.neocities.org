Arthur William "Art" Bell the III is an American broadcaster and author known 
as one of the founders and the original host of the paranormal-themed radio program Coast to Coast AM.
<P>
One of Bell's claim to fame is that on the 11th of September in the space year 
of 1997, a man claiming to have worked at Area 51 called into the show, it would 
seem he was on the run, he spoke with the frenzied voice of a man terrified for <img src="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/bryan_j.l.%20glass.jpg" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
his life, describing "extra-dimensional" beings and plots by the government that 
would drastically, and horrifically, change our world.
<P>

<font color="gold">Caller: Hi... I don't have a whole lot of time... Um...</font color>
<P>
<font color="pink">Art Bell: Well look, let's begin by finding out whether you're using this line properly or not</font color>
<P>
<font color="gold">Caller: Air-Area 51</font color>
<P>
<font color="pink">Art Bell: Yeah, that's right. Were you an employee or are you now?</font color>
<P>
<font color="gold">Caller: I am a former employee</font color>
<P>
<font color="pink">Art Bell: Former employee</font color>
<P>
<font color="gold">Caller: I was let go on a medical discharge about a week ago. And... And 
[He is sobbing] I kinda been running across the country... Um... Um... Man I don't know where to start
They're... They're gonna, um, they'll triangulate on this position really, really soon</font color>
<P>
<font color="pink">Art Bell: So you can't spend a lot of time on the phone, so give us somthing quick</font color>
<P>
<font color="gold">Caller: Okay... Um... Um.. Okay, what we're thinking of as, as aliens Art... They're... 
Uh, they're extra-dimensional beings that... An earlier precursor of the space program made contact with.
Uh... They are not what they claim to be... Uh... They have infiltrated a lt of, uh, uh um-uh a lot of-of-of 
aspects of the Military Establishment and particularly the Area 51
Uh... The disasters that are coming they... The Military... I am sorry... 
The-the goverment knows about them and there's a lot of safe areas in this world 
that they could begin' moving the population now, Art</font color>
<P>
<font color="pink">Art Bell: But they are not doing, but they are not doing anything?</font color>
<P>
<font color="gold">Caller: They are not!
They want the major population centers, wiped out... So that the few that are left will be 
more easily controllable!</font color>
<P>

<P>
<font color="red">New Caller: Just a couple, just 15- 20 seconds, I'd say</font color>
<P>
<font color="pink">Art Bell: Oh you guys really missed a call and I have a feeling someone didn't want you to hear it</font color>
<P>
<font color="red">New Caller: Ummm, 'cause it was really strange noise that I'm hearing Mark Fleming-</font color>
<P>
<font color="pink">Art Bell: -Well that's right the network, the network went, of course immediately to a backup tape while 
we try to figure out what blew up here</font color>
<P>
<font color="red">New Caller: Uh-hu</font color>
<P>
<font color="pink">Art Bell: So that's what you heard happening</font color>

<P>
<font color="red">New Caller: So I wanted to say one thing and ask another</font color>
<P>
<font color="pink">Art Bell: Real quick!</font color>
<P>
<font color="red">New Caller: So I wanted to ask if you could play that, um remote viewing, one while you go to Egypt</font color>
<P>
<font color="pink">Art Bell: Yes</font color>
<P>
<font color="red">New Caller: Oh and also I wanted to know uh... 
The stuff about like Area 51 and if the governments trying to put it out there like that so... 
Like some other places being watched as much?</font color>
<P>
<font color="pink">Art Bell: So in other words your saying it's a big decoy, I see what you say
Well, apparantly we're back after the news. I think.</font color>

[Music plays on]

<P>
The man made a return call on the 28th of April of the same year, admitting that 
the original call was fake, <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/clive/ttuc.html#However">however</a>, the second caller's voice, tone and mannerisms 
have called into question whether this was the same person or not.
<P>
Let's not lie to ourselves here, it was probably fake, comic book writer Bryan J. L. 
Glass (pictured) called into Jimmy Church's Fade to Black claiming to be the man behind the call.
