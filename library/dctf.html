<img src="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/floppydisk_by_floppyjay.gif" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>Remember floppy disks? No, either do I, but I looked them up on Wikipedia and according to them, they 
are disk storage, like a USB, yeah, what a shite intro.
<P>
The only reason why someone would still want to use a floppy disk is probably because they have a 
warez copy of <a href="https://archive.org/details/msdos_Commander_Keen_-_Keen_Dreams_1993">Commander Keen</a> 
or <a href="https://archive.org/details/msdos_Wolfenstein_3D_1992">Wolf 3D</a> and don't know what the <a href="https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_msdos_games">Internet Archive</a> is for. 
<P>
It would 
seem that in the 90's illegal copies of software was quite popular, so popular in fact that the 
Software Publishers Association (now Software & Information Industry Association) produced the gem 
known as "Don't Copy That Floppy", a great public information film that shows the side-effects of 
making illegal copies of software.
<P>
The SPA idea of telling children not to make warez copies of stuff is to act rad 'n' kewl, man. You can tell if this was made today 
it would have <a href="https://www.thetruth.com/">hashtags</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPS9Op5dhCw">memes</a> and 
be, as the kids say "cringy". There seems to be something innocent about this <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/clive/ttuc.html#PIF">PIF</A>, like the people who made it were unaware that the 
movie is extremely cheesy.

For the love of God, don't tell them about shareware.
<P>
One more thing, if you watched the credits you would have seen that there was one Craig Dykstra, who was a programmer for AOL, who in 2010 
was charged with hiding a camera during post-prom party full of underage teens... yikes.
