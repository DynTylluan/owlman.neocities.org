Reporting late news by Clive "James" Python. That's "<i>Python</i>" as "<i>pi fun</i>" not "<i>pi fon</i>" you fucking American twat.
<P>
Anyway, after days of me not writing anything I decided to write about this woman who took her doggo to a furry con by miskake.
<P>
<i>God, this website is going downhill.</i>
<P>
The story goes on the lines of Cheryl Wassus (who works for 
<a href="http://www.petsforvets.com/">Pets for Vets</A>) got 
invited to the 2017 <a href="https://motorcityfurrycon.org/">Motor City Furry Convention</a>, 
being that Wassus is a normie she had no idea what a "furry" is - it would have been for the 
best if it was kept that way. Now normies all around the world know about furries - not that 
I am a furry. 
<P><IMG SRC="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/all-furry-art-is-cropedfrom-porn.png" align=left hspace=15 vspace=5>
When Cheryl Wassus was invited to the convention she assumed that she and Link, 
her one-year-old Bernese mountain dog, would be spending the day at an animal event. 
<P>
She was kind of right... they were more... anthropomorphized than most doggos.... 
<P>
When asked - by I can only guess to be <a href="http://nymag.com/author/Madison%20Malone%20Kircher/">Madison Malone Kircher</A> of <a href="http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/04/woman-brings-therapy-dog-to-furry-convention.html">Select All</A> - 
"what did you think you were walking into on Saturday?" she said this about it;
<P><tt><blockquote>
You know, I have been affiliated with Pets for Vets for a while, and what I try to do is 
promote the program. I've got a really nice dog who has been trained with the benchmarks 
[for being a certified therapy dog] ... so it's nice to take Link and get him out there and 
have him exposed - because he is a young dog - to lots of different things. I really had 
no idea what to expect going in on Saturday. This organization had chosen us as their 
charity. They actually solicited us, and adopted us more or less, as their go-to charity 
for this big function. This is just a whole subculture I wasn't even aware existed. When 
we set up tables and do promos and educate the public and do outreach, I had no idea the 
outreach was going to be other human ... furry people. I guess you're never too old to learn.
