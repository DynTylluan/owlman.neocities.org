- Kunt
</tt></blockquote><P>
Somewhere in the darkest, dampest, stickiest part of Basildon, Essex lived 
a man, he was not a good man, he was not a bad man, he was just a man. His 
name was Kunt, he made music on the Internet.
<P>
Sadly in Kunt's 13-year career, he's had very little fame, this could be 
for two reasons, one <i>his name</i> and second, what he sings about.
<P>
Yeah, if you can't tell by his name, Kunt likes to sing about off-<a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/clive/ttuc.html#Words He Can't Spell">colour</A> 
subjects, one of his <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/clive/ttuc.html#Words He Can't Spell">favourites</A> 
seems to be about <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/clive/ttuc.html#Wanker">wanking</A>, taking it up the arse and B rate celebrities from the UK.
<P>
When asked "<i>will you sign my tits / arse / cock / bollocks, etc.?</i>", he said;
<P>
<tt><blockquote>
I have a strict policy that I only sign ladies' body parts after some bloke 
asked me to sign his arse cheek one time and just as my pen touched his cheek 
he farted and followed through. It was fucking disgusting. Since then I have 
refused to sign blokes' cocks, blokes' bollocks and blokes' arseholes. And 
don't think you've found a loophole by trying to get me to do that bit in 
between your bollocks and your arsehole because I'm not doing that either.
</tt></blockquote>
<P>
This has nothing to do with the artical - I just found it very funny.
<P>
Kunt and The Gang, after all, are a gang and you can't have a gang of one - I think 
- that's why he has a mate, his mate is Litle Kunt - a <i>hand puppet</i>, yes a <i>hand puppet</i>. 
But he's not a normal <i>hand puppet</i>, he's a normal <i>hand puppet</i> who made a <i>hand puppet</i> 
album, Kuntrarian, that you can <a href="http://www.kuntandthegang.co.uk/littlekunt.html">download for free from his website</a>!!!
<P>
If you get easily offended then you <b>should not</b> play KATG, or else. But, if you're a bad person like I am, then you may like the music.... or not, I don't know you...
