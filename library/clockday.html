So it's Clock Day, <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/28240">B</a> has now been on Newgrounds for 15 years. 15 years it a long time for the worst flash on the site, well done guys!
<P>
I feel like <a href="http://trystlions.newgrounds.com/">trystlions</a> sums up what I think about this flash;

Symbolic of Newgrounds poor attitiude to spam</br>

This pathetic attempt at lame humor is symbolic of alot of the problems of Newgrounds. A simple letter B should have never passed judement is 1 millon years, The large amount of people voting 10 and giving a high score is disgusting.</br>

So to all the incompotent buffons out there, take a long hard look at yourself before you blast this review as useless. The idea that giving this nonsence a high score is crazy and unintelligent. Newgrounds is supposed to be home of high quality flash animation not spam.</br>

What is the point in living when there are people dedicated in causing chaos when something so stupid should really be destroyed?</br>

Any fool could make this and by spam voting 5 or 10, you are pretty much giving your entire backing and support to encorage futher spam on what should really be the best website on the internet.</br>

(Also keep in mind, this is how I feel about B, and not <a href="http://strawberryclock.newgrounds.com">StrawberryClock</a>)
