<P>
If you have ever seen my Godawful comic known as The "<A HREF="https://owlman.neocities.org/comic/">OWLMAN COMIC</A>" you will 
know that I have tried (and failed) to animate, unlike the nice people at <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/rsj.html">Klasky</a>, 
I use very basic tools to animate, such as MS Paint and MS Movie Maker.......... <i>Anyway</i>, here is some shite I made yesterday.
