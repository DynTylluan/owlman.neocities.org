<P>
In October of 1995, Gary Kremen, best known for founding Match.com, registered sex.com with 
<a href="https://www.networksolutions.com">Network Solutions</a>, but he did not develop the 
site as he focused on growing Match.com.
<P>
In 1995, <i>Network Solutions</i> transferred - without permission - the domain to Stephen M. Cohen, who had
been trying to get control of the URL for some time now by misrepresentation, using phone 
calls, e-mails and forged letters. Interestedly, in the 1980's Cohen operated a paid-membership 
<a href="https://archive.org/details/BBS.The.Documentary">BBS</A> known as
the "French Connection" that was geared toward swinging and other sexual topics. In the late 80's he 
organized swinger get-togethers at a home in Orange County, California. In 1990, 
he was arrested for operating a sex club in a residential zone; but was found not 
guilty by a jury verdict, but we're getting off topic here.
<P>
After he misrepresented Gary Kremen, he 
would eventually persuaded an employee of Network Solutions to 
change the ownership details by submitting a fake fax from Kremen's company <i>Online Classified</i>, 
fraudulently stating that Kremen had been dismissed and the firm was abandoning the domain and that Cohen could have it. 
<P>
Network Solutions blindly accepted the fax with no verification and transferred 
the domain to Cohen, by doing this, Kremen would later use this against Network Solutions in a civil suit.

<P>
After he gained control of the domain, Cohen started an advertising-heavy site that received up to 25 million hits a day.
With help from payments for click-throughs and other advertising, Cohen was reportedly making $50,000 to $500,000 per month.
Kreman would undertake steps to recover the URL, while Cohen claimed he obtained the domain legally from Online Classifieds (OCI). A five-year
legal battle would be ensured, led by cyberlawyer Charles Carreon
<P>
In November of 2000, Kreman won the battle, Network Solutions was ordered to 
return the domain to him. According to the court record of <i>Kremen v. Cohen</i>, Cohen was
ordered to pay $25 million into court in April 2001, the California 
District Court awarded Kremen an additional $40 million for lost earnings, for 
a total judgment of $65 million.
<P>
Cohan would appeal the judgment and refused to 
allow assessment of his business: He provided false information and declared 
most of his companies bankrupt while illegally moving assets out of US 
jurisdiction. When an arrest warrant was put on Cohan's head, he would flee to Mexico
<P>
Kremen 
offered a $50,000 reward for information about Cohen, but Cohen remained at large while 
continuing to file appeals that were rejected. In October 2005, Cohen was 
arrested in Tijuana, Mexico for immigration violations, and was handed over 
to US authorities.
<P>
Kremen settled his lawsuit against Network Solutions for an undisclosed amount.
<P>
Cohen would be released from custody on the 5th of December 2006, by Chief Judge James Ware.
<P>
Cohen would continue to avoid paying the $67 million judgment and claimed poverty. The courts would find in favour 
of Kremen since 2006, with evidence that <b>seven individuals</b> and 
<b>twelve companies</b> were used to help Cohen hide the money, including his brother, his daughter, 
his ex-wife and also his former lawyer. A court case against his brother is currently ongoing. 
<P>
In May 2012, Sex.com was relaunched by Clover Holdings LTD in May of 2012, for p-p-p-porn.
