Today I was looking around Neocitie websites when I found a site called 
"<a href="https://thebrokensetonline.neocities.org">Broken Set Online</a>", 
I saw that they did a <a href="https://thebrokensetonline.neocities.org/spec.html">page about 
their computer</a>, so, because I have no original ideas, I'm going to steal theirs.
<P>
So, this is my PC!
<P><tt><blockquote>
This is what the keyboard looks like, real nice, great for playing games!<p>

</tt></blockquote>Made in, I think 2006, I used this baby for some time, yeah there is no spacebar, no right arrow, the 
letters E, Y, U, I, P, D, D, J, V and N are no more and <i>sure</i>, it runs <i>really slow</i>, but, it 'still' works!
