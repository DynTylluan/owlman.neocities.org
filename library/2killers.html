<P>
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold wanted to be famous, they wanted their life to be made into a movie, they even speculated 
on whether Steven Spielberg or Quentin Tarantino would direct it.
<P>
The two boys seemed to like making shitty things that we shell cover now...
<P>
<h1>The Basement Tapes</h1>
<P>
Just like with <a href="http://owlman.neocities.org/library/cannibalism.html">Meiwes and Brandes</a>, the two 
boys made home movies in c. 1999, all known as "The Basement Tapes".
<P>
In December of 1999, the tapes were given to the late Tim Roche of Time Magazine, whom with Nancy Gibbs
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140430025340/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,992873,00.html">wrote an article on the five tapes</a>, this would
have been the first time that the public would know about said tapes. What is odd here is that the 
family members of the deceased threatened to sue Jefferson County, considering the fact that not even they had 
been given access to the recordings. They came to an agreement, with Jefferson County 
quickly screening the tapes for them, and then vaulting them away "indefinitely."

So far only two out of five tapes were officially released to the public, the other three are 
claimed to be destroyed because of fear of potential <i><a href="http://owlman.neocities.org/library/jeffweise.html">copycat violence</a></i>.
<P>
The Two found tapes are easy to find online, the two tapes are "<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170122173758/http://my.mixtape.moe/ldgyow.mp4">Hitman for Hire</a>" and
"<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgCyQRVF3Cs">Rampart Range</a>"; in both of the movies, Eric and Dylan try (and fail) to seem kewl 'n' kickass by dressing themselves in long leather coats and playing with guns.
<P><tt><blockquote>
<A HREF="http://lostmediawiki.com/The_Basement_tapes_(lost_Columbine_killers_video_diary;_1999)">TEXT FROM THE LOST MEDIA WIKI</A></br>
Brief overviews of the 3 unreleased tapes.
<P>
<li>Evidence item #265 (One 8mm tape, recorded mid-March 1999):
<P>
This tape begins with footage of Harris and Klebold in Harris' house on 
March 15, drinking Jack Daniels, and talking about how they hope that 
the videos that they're making will soon be shown all over the world, 
once their so-called "masterpiece" had been completed, and when everyone 
would be looking for answers. They talk about how they used various people 
to acquire their weapons, before referring to a classmate of theirs, Brandon 
Larson and how "you will find his body." They then move onto discussing the 
weapons, before getting into their personal philosophical views, and 
talking about various people who they believed had done them wrong. 
They continue showing off their arsenal of weapons, whilst making 
subtle references to their planned massacre.
<P>
The camera then cuts to a shot later in the day, where the two are talking 
about their plan in greater detail, bragging about how many people they are 
going to kill. They suggest that their story should be made into a film, 
speculating on whether Steven Spielberg or Quentin Tarantino would direct it.
<P>
The tape then cuts in and out once again, to the two boys on March 18 "in 
the middle of the night." Again, they talk about their plans to murder 
people, before discussing various things such as credit card fraud and 
tests, and inventing excuses on why they would need certain parts that 
they were still to purchase for their upcoming attack, in case anyone 
was to ask them. They ponder if the police will watch the entire footage 
of the tapes, then suggest that the authorities would probably slice the 
footage up, omitting certain parts to convey a specific image of the 
killers, twisting their words so to speak. Finally, they talk about how 
they wanted copies of their videos to be sent to 4 news networks before 
Harris briefly references his journal. The tape then ends.
<P>
<li>Evidence item #298 (Two 8mm tapes, one recorded April 11 1999, one date unknown):
<P>
The first of these two tapes is labelled "Reb's Tape" (Reb being Harris' nickname), 
and shows footage of the two in the front of a car, stating that "We are on our way 
to get the rest of our gear", before revealing the date, April 11, and claiming that 
"We've been planning this for over eight months". The camera then cuts out and back 
into the two once again driving, revealing that they had just purchased two large 
fuel containers, as well as three propane bottles.
<P>
The tape then stops once more, before cutting back to a closeup of Harris' face; 
he is now alone and begins to talk about his family, apologising for the agony 
that he knew the coming events would put them through and telling them that it 
was not their fault. He states that there are seven and one-third days left, 
before listing off five names. Finally, Harris turns the camera to his previously 
seen journal which he now dubs the "Writings of God," flicking through the book 
while talking about his beliefs, before showing various "Doom drawings" that he 
had done near the back of the book. The tape then finishes.
<P>
The second tape simply contained small amounts of footage of Klebold, Harris and 
two other boys, presumably in footage recorded for a school project. As such, 
most people don't count this additional tape as part of the "Basement Tapes" 
(it has been included here for reference reasons, and due to the fact that it 
is counted by authorities as part of evidence item #298).
<P>
<li>Evidence item #333 (One 8mm tape, recorded late-March to April 20 1999):
<P>
This tape was found by authorities in a Sony 8mm video camera with "Columbine 
High School" engraved on the side (evidence item #200). The tape was labelled 
"Top Secret Rampart." It begins with footage of Harris and Klebold in Harris' 
home, with Harris filming. Weapons can be seen on the floor, such as pipe 
bombs (which Harris begins to describe in detail), as well as two guns (a 
sawn-off shotgun and a carbine) and two boxes of bullets. Shortly afterwards, 
Klebold takes the camera and aims it at Harris, who is now holding the guns.
<P>
The camera then cuts out and back in, now showing Harris (in different clothing) 
again holding the guns. The two converse for a while, then the tape cuts out again. 
When the footage cuts back in, it is of Harris alone in a moving car, with the 
camera mounted on the dashboard. He then begins to apologise to various friends 
for what he had planned to do, talks about how "It's a weird feeling knowing 
you're going to be dead in two and a half weeks", about whether he "should do 
it before or after prom", and that he would have liked to have re-visited 
Michigan and some "old friends". He then falls silent and begins to cry, 
wiping a tear from his face, before shutting the camera off.
<P>
The next cut-in shows the two men in Klebold's bedroom, fiddling around with 
their weapons and securing guns to their clothing (the same clothing that they 
would die in). Harris once again mentions Brandon Larson and talks about his 
head being on his knife (despite the two threats made towards Larson in the 
videos, he did not end up being one of their victims). They talk some more 
about various things before the camera once again cuts out.
<P>
The next footage seen is that of Klebold and Harris once again in Harris' 
home. Harris is filming Klebold. "Say it now" speaks Harris, prompting 
Klebold to begin giving a goodbye message to his friends and family. 
Klebold then takes the camera and films Harris, who too, records a goodbye 
message. The final words spoken on the recording are of Harris saying "That's 
it. Sorry. Goodbye", before Kleold sticks his face in the camera and also says 
"Goodbye." The final image is a few seconds of the static camera facing a sign 
on the wall of Harris' bedroom (partially blocked by someone's arm in the 
camera's line of sight), with a haunting image of the letters "CHS", along 
with a bomb with a lit fuse, and the word "clue", written in bold black 
lettering. Authorities have determined that this last piece of footage 
was taken roughly 30 minutes before the attack.

<a href="#doom"></a><a name="doom"></a><h1>It's Going to be Like Fuckin' Doom</h1>
<P><img src="http://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/doom.png" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
<a href="http://owlman.neocities.org/library/doom.html">Doom</a> is a kick-arse game, published in 1993 by id Software. Everyone who has ever played this 
game has loved it and if any Sunny Jim tell you otherwise, their lying and you should not trust them.
<P>
Like any teen in the 90's Harris would have loved Doom, loved it so much that on the 17th of January 1999 he wrote
a short story for his class, in which he describes a game of Doom from the 
first person perspective, including gathering up bullets and weapons and witnessing piles of 
bodies. His Teacher gave him a C+ and wrote;
<P>
<tt><blockquote>
Yours is a unique approach and your writing works 
in a gruesome way - good details and mood setting
</tt></blockquote>
<P>
It would seem his love for Doom when so far he made his own mods for the game
well, for Doom II... Most of the mods are deathmatch maps and are crap.
<P>
If you want to play the mods, there are some archives online such as <a href="http://www.acolumbinesite.com/eric/doom.html">A Columbine Site</a> 
and by your dear old <a href="http://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/rebdoomer/">OwlMan</A>. As I said, most of the mods are crap and not worth
your time. If you <i>really</i> must play one of them I would say play <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170118021345/http://www.geocities.ws/owlman/rebdoomer/uaclabs.zip">uaclabs.wad</A>, as
it's quite a well-made map that is fun to play, despite the fact it was made by a killer.
<P>
Because people knew Eric liked Doom, it became a scapegoat for people. If <i>Doom</i> really was what caused Eric to kill, then we should also blame
other random things such as <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> for promoting ultra-violence, we should blame <i>Judas Priest</i> for the death of James Vance and Raymond Belknap, we should 
put the blame on <i>Star Wars</i> for gun violence.
<P>
It is not the media who is to blame here, it is the people who carried out the act.
<P>
Oh, and one last thing, if <i>you</i> the person reading this feels unsure about playing
the mods here, don't. No one will blame you if you don't play them.
<P>

<h1>Doom WAD that Resembled Columbine High School..?</h1>
<P>
Being that this is the Internet, there is a lot of <i>he said she said bullshit</i> around Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, such as a false claim that Eric
made a mod for Doom that looked like various parts of his high school, including the library. Instead of monsters as the 
target, he targeted students in the custom made levels.
<P>
This is not true in any way, Doom modding wasn't that advanced in the late 90s to support room-over-room levels and anyone who thinks otherwise, or 
<a href="http://youtu.be/NLnKLbFmqLQ?t=54s">makes a YouTube video spreading misinformation</A> does not know how Doom works.
<P>
There was a mod later made for Doom II called <a href="http://www.wad-archive.com/wad/30109c5d9b7a262932be55a8e6b2b18d">ColumbineDOOM2</a> that was of the 
high school, some <i>really</i> 
<a href="http://youtu.be/NLnKLbFmqLQ?t=54s">dumb people</a> believe that Harris made this mod, despite
the fact that <a href="http://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/are_you_joking.jpg">THIS 
IS THE FIRST THING YOU SEE WHEN YOU OPEN THE WAD</a>.
<P>
<h1>Trench Coat Mafia</h1>
<P>
In 1994 a loner student at Columbine High School was given a black duster 
(trench coat) as a gift from his mother, it would seem he was fond of it, 
as he wore it to school, soon after, the student's friend started wearing 
a black trench coat as well, because he liked the style. It wasn't long 
before others followed suit. The students went as far as keeping the 
coats on in hot weather.<img src="http://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/tcmyearbook.jpg" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
<P>
It was not long until the jocks in the school started to call them "a 
trench coat mafia" after this, the group of friends took on the name 
and wore it like a badge, adopting the name for themselves, "The Trench 
Coat Mafia" or just <i>TCM</i> for short.
<P>
The TCM wore all black and in attempts to fight back against the popular 
athletes and jocks in the school, the Trench Coat Mafia ridiculed the 
jocks right back, attempting to stand up against bullies in the school 
by being anti-bully rangers.
<P>
Let me get one thing out of the way here. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold 
were never a part of the TCM, they had friends who were in it, but that 
was as far as it went.
<P>
Soon after the shooting <a href="http://owlman.neocities.org/library/rotten.html">Soylent 
Communications</a> registered <a href="http://trenchcoat.org/">trenchcoat.org</A>, 
the site has some <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Atrenchcoat.org">unlisted pages</a>, that if you want to look at go ahead.
<P>
The landing page is just full of hate-mail, such as this lovely one from Sieve 31;

Thank you for that lovely letter, on the subject of hate-mail, here is one <a href="http://tomfulp.newgrounds.com/">Tom Fulp</a> of <a href="http://newgrounds.com/">Newgrounds</a>

<tt><blockquote>Tom:
<P>
I am not in the habit of emailing the producers of web sites, but I found yours so disturbing that I have to 
send this. In light of what happened at Columbine High School, your site is terribly sick. It may or may not 
have played at part in what happened, but the image of a person with a gun in a long coat cannot be assigned 
to simple coincidence. You probably will write this off as just another person giving you the attention you 
so badly crave. This is not the case. I'm a Ph.D. who thinks we all need to take responsibility for what we 
do, write, and say. You are no exception.

<h1>On The Web</h1>
<P>
Both the boys had an online profile ("<i>Internet killers</i>") and screen names, Eric was <i>REB DoMiNe</i> and Dylan was known as <i>v0dKa</i>. Althow v0dKa used
the Net, it was REB who used it the most, seeing that he made his own web page where he wrote about things he liked such
as Doom, <i>unfunny jokes</i>, long rants and all while using very basic HTML. <!-- Like this page -->
<P>
Because Eric Harris is <i>sooo</i> funny one of his (shit) web pages had some <i>really funny</i> <a href="http://acolumbinesite.com/eric/mama.html">JO MAMMA! jokes</a>, such 
as these (take note Billy Connolly);
<P>
<tt><blockquote>
Jo mamma is so fat that she cant find very many diet plans that help her! JJJEEEEYAAA!!
<P>
Jo mamma is so fat the people say, "damn, theres a obese woman."! JJJEEEEYAAA!!
<P>
Jo mamma is so old that she has lots of grey hairs! and they are even overdue! JJJEEEEYAAA!!
<P>
Jo mamma's car is so blue, that people say its almost black! JJJEEEEYAAA!!
<P><img src="http://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/duck_dvd.jpg" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
Jo mamma scissors are so dull, that she cant cut paper very well with them! JJJEEEEYAAA!!
</tt></blockquote>
<P>
You just know if Eric was alive today he would be doing rage comics.
<P>
Long after the attack, like long after, people online seemed to be <i>idolising</i> both the boys such as in 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170124215709/http://russmud.deviantart.com/art/eric-harris-4136513">this great art</a> or <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20151101132650/http://pyschopathicx16.deviantart.com/art/Victims-147445061">how about this?</a>
<P>
Oh, and one last thing, the boys did get a movie made about them, six months after their attack, not directed by Steven Spielberg or Quentin Tarantino, but by
William Hellfire and Joey Smack, the movie being "<i>Duck! The Carbine High Massacre</i>". It's a "<i>comedy</i>" movie staring 
Derwin (William Hellfire) and Derick (Joey Smack). No one should watch it, not because of the theme, let's face it, it's because it's <i>shite</i> and unfunny.
<P>
After the film was released, Hellfire and Smack were arrested for possession of weapons on school property. The film is said to have helped pay for Hellfire's legal fees.
