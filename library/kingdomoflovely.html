The Kingdom of Lovely is not really a real place, as it only on the Internet
 and has no land of its own. Lovely was started by King Danny I (Danny 
 Wallace, a British comedian) for the T.V. programme, How to Start Your Own Country, that aired on BBC Two in 2005.
 <P>
The programme was about King Danny I going around the world and meeting 
people who know about that short of stuff, like Dennis Hope, who in 1980 
claimed the moon for himself (Hope does not really own the moon)<img src="/library/img/KoL.png" width="200" height="150" align=left hspace=15 vspace=5>
<P>
<a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/clive/ttuc.html#However">However</A> in later years less and less people are going to <a href="http://lovelycountry.net">lovelycountry.net</a> 
(Lovely's capital city (I only say that it is the capital city only because 
it is the home page for Lovely)) this is probably because it is a joke that is now old.
<P>
The national anthem of the Kingdom of Lovely is called is called 'National anthem of the Kingdom 
of Lovely by Banks &amp; Wag' sang by King Danny I
