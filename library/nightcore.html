I'd just like to remind people that the OwlMan Library's motto is "Good to Forget", so keep that in mind while reading this.
<P>

Some time in early 2014 I was invited to a Skype group channel, a lot of the people in said 
channel were fans of <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/mttfa.html">Anime</a>, I'll admit that 
I've never really been into Anime, the only time that I've watched any was on Chrismas just because it 
was on the telly, anyway, I saw that the creator of the group had posted a link, a link to a video called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy8QkoCgm_Q">Hanging Tree</A>".
<P>
Good God, when I played the music it was just.... <i>bad</i>, it was like Alvin and The Chipmunks, but Anime.
<P>
Looking up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=nightcore">Nightcore on YouTube</A> you will - for some reason - you will find 14,800,000 results, most of them are just covers of much better songs.
<P>
It's crazy what covers you can find; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cw6HA3RWBEg">David Bowie</A>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6EEQnu9jRo">AC/DC</A>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hKUIuK7_2g">Pink Floyd</A> and even 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idIDtSRUb94">They Might Be Giants</A>. Is nothing sacred to these people?
<P>
If I was you, I would stay far, far, far away from nightcore, it's a <a href="http://poetry.rotten.com/spiral/">downward spiral</A>.
<P>
I'm sorry if this has been a crap read, but I do this for free, so shut it!
