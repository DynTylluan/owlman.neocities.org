So, two Judas Priest Fans <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/jpfcs.html">commit suicide because of a song</a>, Weird Al 
<a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/al.html">does a song about
wanking</a> and some guy names his band "<a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/kunt.html">Kunt and the Gang</a>" - that ain't shit compared to
the Norwegian black metal band <i>Mayhem</i>.
<P>
Formed in 1984 in Oslo by guitarist &Oslash;ystein "Destructor" Aarseth, 
bassist J&oslash;rn "Necrobutcher" Stubberud and drummer Kjetil Manheim, taking their band name from the Venom song "Mayhem with Mercy", 
the band would become synonymous with death and destruction.

<h1>Per "Dead" Ohlin</h1>
<P>
<tt><blockquote>
[Dead] wasn't a guy you could know very well. I think even the 
other guys in Mayhem didn't know him very well. He was hard to 
get close to. I'd met him maybe six to eight times, in all. He 
had lots of weird ideas. I remember Aarseth was talking about 
him and said he did not have any humour. He did, but it was very
 obscure. Honestly, I don't think he was enjoying living in 
 this world.
<P>

<P>
Born on the 16th of January <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/moondisaster.html">1969</A>, Per "Dead" Ohlin suffered from 
sleep apnea and at ten, he suffered internal bleeding when his spleen ruptured, after what he alleged was an ice skating accident.
His brother said in an interview that at school Ohlin was bullied - and one day the beatings got out of hand causing the <img src="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/mayhem/dead.jpg" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
ruptured spleen. He had to be rushed to a hospital, 
where he was for a time clinically dead. After this near-death experience, he became 
enthralled with death and dying, and, as a result, was given the pseudonym "Dead".
<P>
Dead would became the lead singer of Mayhem in 1988
<P>
It has been reported that unlike most people, Dead would bury 
his clothes and dig them up again to wear them on stage, Jan 
Axel "Hellhammer" Blomberg the drummer for Mayhem said this about it;
<P><blockquote><tt>
Before the shows, Dead used to bury his clothes into the ground so that they could start to rot and 
get that grave scent. He was a corpse on a stage. Once he even asked us to bury <i>him</i> in the ground - 
he wanted his skin to become pale.
</blockquote></tt>
<P>
In his short lifetime, Dead suffered from suicidal tendencies, it was 
reported that he would try and cut himself while he was with friends, 
who would have to subdue him and patch him up.
<P>
Although this upset many of his friends, guitarist Euronymous became 
fascinated with Dead's suicidal tendencies - seemingly because it fit 
Mayhem's image - and according to them, he <i>encouraged Dead to kill himself</i>.
<P>
drummer Kjetil Manheim said tat "I don't know if &Oslash;ystein did it out of 
pure evil or if he was just fooling around."
<P>
Honestly, the next paragraph is from Wikipedia, but it sums up how fucked up some of the band members were.
<P>
By 1991, Dead, Euronymous and Hellhammer were living in a house in the woods near Kr&aring;kstad, 
which was used as a place for the band to rehearse. According to Hellhammer, Dead spent much 
of his time writing letters and drawing. He "just sat in his room and became more and more 
depressed". Mayhem bassist Necrobutcher said that, after living together for a while, 
Dead and Euronymous "got on each other's nerves a lot". Hellhammer recalls that Dead 
once went outside to sleep in the woods because Euronymous was playing synth music that 
Dead hated. Euronymous then went outside and began shooting into the air with a shotgun.
 Varg Vikernes of Burzum claims that Dead once stabbed Euronymous with a knife. 
He also claims to have sent Mayhem ammunition, including shotgun shells, as a Christmas 
gift, although he claimed those were not the shells Dead used to kill himself, and that 
he saved a special shell for his suicide.

<P>
On the 8th of April 1991, Dead was left in the house on his 
own, he would decide to kill himself by slitting his wrists 
and throat with a knife when this failed he would shoot 
himself in the forehead with a shotgun killing him.
<P>
Dead would leave a suicide letter;
<blockquote><tt>
Excuse the blood, but I have slit my wrists and neck. It was the intention 
that I would die in the woods so that it would take a few days before I was 
possibly found. I belong in the woods and have always done so. No one will 
understand the reason for this anyway. To give some semblance of an 
explanation I'm not a human, this is just a dream and soon I will awake. 
It was too cold and the blood kept clotting, plus my new knife is too dull. 
If I don't succeed dying to the knife I will blow all the shit out of my 
skull. Yet I do not know. I left all my lyrics by "Let the good times 
roll"—plus the rest of the money. Whoever finds it gets the fucking 
thing. As a last salutation may I today "Life Eternal". Do whatever 
you want with the fucking thing. / Pelle.
<P>
I didn't come up with this now, but seventeen years ago.
</blockquote></tt>
<P>
Because of Dead's attitude towards his own life, it is believed by 
some that he suffered from the rare mental illness known as Cotard 
delusion - also known as "walking corpse syndrome" - to sum up the 
mental illness, it is basically when people think that they are 
already dead, do not exist, are putrefying, or have lost their 
blood or internal organs.
<P>
Dead's body was first found by Euronymous, who did not phone the 
police first but went to a shop to buy a disposable camera, he 
would re-arrange some items then take a photo of the body.
<P>
After Hellhammer developed the photos, Euronymous promised to 
destroy the pictures (if they were going to be destroyed why did 
Hellhammer take the time to developed them?), but ultimately did 
not. He kept them in an envelope at his record shop called 
"Helvete". Euronymous allegedly sent one of the pictures to the 
owner of Warmaster Records in Colombia and it was used as the 
cover of the 1995 bootleg live album Dawn of the Black Hearts.
<P>
Euronymous, being the piece of shit he is, used Dead's suicide 
to foster Mayhem's "evil" image and claimed Dead had killed 
himself because death metal had become "trendy" and commercialised.
<P>
The death of Dead caused many of Euronymous' friends too - quite 
understandably - be disgusted by his attitude towards Dead before 
the suicide and how he was like afterwards. Necrobutcher would 
end his friendship with Euronymous.
<P>
If you want another reason to dislike Euronymous; Manheim would 
speculate that Euronymous had wilfully left Dead alone in the 
house so that he would have a chance to kill himself.
<P>

<h1>&Oslash;ystein "Euronymous" Aarseth</h1>

<P>
<img src="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/mayhem/euronymous.png" width="151" height="245" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
Born on the 22nd of March 1968, &Oslash;ystein Aarseth would co-found <i>Mayhem</i> in 1984. 
He would also form the now defunct independent record label "Deathlike Silence Productions" in the late 1980's.
<P>
After Euronymous was a total psycho to Dead and <i>may or may not have caused</i> 
Dead's death, a rumour had came out that he made a stew with bits of Dead's brain 
and had made necklaces with bits of his skull (the latter of the two rumors is most 
likely true) as he gave the necklaces to musicians he deemed worthy, which was 
confirmed by several other members of the scene, like Bård "Faust" Eithun, 
Metalion and Morgan Håkansson. 
<img src="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/mayhem/vv.jpg" align=left hspace=15 vspace=5>
<P>
Euronymous would be killed on the 10th of August 
1993 by Varg Vikernes (as seen on the left. Born 
Kristian Vikernes, legally Louis Cachet). He 
would be found outside of his flat with 23 
cut wounds – two to the head, five to the 
neck and sixteen to the back.
<P>
<tt><blockquote>
I believe in a horned devil, a personified Satan. In my opinion all the 
other forms of Satanism are bullshit. [...] Satanism comes from religious 
Christianity, and there it shall stay. I'm a religious person and I will 
fight those who misuse His name. People are not supposed to believe in 
themselves and be individualists. They are supposed to OBEY, to be the 
SLAVES of religion
<P>
- Euronymous in an interview by Esa Lahdenper&auml; early August 1993
</tt><blcokquote>
<P>
Vikernes' trial began on the 2nd of May 1994; he was 
represented by lawyer, journalist and comedian Stein-Erik Mattsson.
<P>
On the 16th of May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison 
(Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of 
three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church and for the 
theft and storage of 150kg of explosives.
<P>
He would be let out in 2014 with six months of probation and a fine 
of €8,000. He now lives in Limousin, France with his wife, as of 
2017, he has 6 children and has stated he plans to have more.
