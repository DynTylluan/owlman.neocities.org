You may recall that sometime in early 2017 we reported that a 
<a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/fksfm.html">woman was kept in a 
septic tank</A> by her brother for Black Magic. The aim of this was so that he would 
become rich - it would seem that his aim worked.
<P>
According to Best Gore user <a href="http://www.bestgore.com/members/happy/">Vincit Omnia Veritas</a> and 
<a href="http://www.bestgore.com/members/brainfart008/">brainfart008</a>, in Amanso Amenfi, Wassa Amenfi 
District, Ghana a 31-year-old farmer named Abdul Salam (as seen on the right) allegedly decapitated and dismembered his 
6-year-old son to use his body parts in a black magic ritual so he would become rich.
<P>
The Best Gore article says that the farmer reportedly intended to send the head and 
the legs to a spiritualist who would perform a ritual to help him get more money.
