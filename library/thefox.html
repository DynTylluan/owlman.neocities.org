<tt>I am not a furry.</tt>
<P>
Right now there is a furry webcomic floating around called "<a href="http://foxdad.com">Fox Dad</A>" - if you 
read any of the strips you will find that it is un<b>furry</b> - I mean un<b>funny</b>. The 
comic's main way of telling jokes is by puns. <i>Really, really bad puns.</i>
<P>
<i>Fox Dad</i> reminded me of another furry webcomic called "T.H.E. Fox". Written by 
Joe Ekaitis (born 1955 in Pennsylvania, USA), the comic ran from 1986 to 1988,
 it centres around the life of a red fox named 'Thaddeus Horatio Eberhard', 
 or sometimes just called 'Thaddeus Fox'.

Because of the age of the comic, it is seen to be one of the first webcomics 
after that of <i>Witches and Stitches</i> and <i>Inspector Dangerfuck</i>. <!-- "Dangerfuck" always makes me crack up -->
<P>
It was first put <span title="GET FUCKING REKT M8 " style="border-bottom:1px dotted black; cursor:help;"><img src="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/thefox/fprize.png" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5></span>
on CompuServe and was drawn as pixel art on a C64 KoalaPad, first using 
KoalaPainter, then Advanced OCP Art Studio. The comic was in sixteen colours 
(or 320x200 in eight) and took from two hours to half a day to complete. 
Later strips were inked, then scanned onto a PC and touched up with Paintbrush (like the one at the top). 
Characters were typically presented in a single plane, though some strips used 
oblique or perspective projection.
<P>
The comic was 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981203133632/http://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/JoeEkaitis/thaddeus.htm">later put on the Web</a> 
and renamed as "Thaddeus".
<P>
Much like <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/comic/">a lot</A> of webcomics T.H.E Fox is unfunny, it seems to rely on the joke 
of "lol, he's a fox". Is this comic worth your time? Not really, unless you're 
into pixel art or historic stuff.
