<TT>This is obviously not a joke and should be taken seriously.</TT><P>

Anime are like Western cartoons! (to a "T") and I love me some cartoons, so, for no reason at all, here
are my Top 10 Favorite Anime!
<P>
Number X<br />
WataMote is a Anime, or should I say <I>cartoon</i>! In this <I>cartoon</i>, the lead protagonist want's 
to fuck her younger brother! <i>Alllll riiight!</i>
<P>
Number IX<br />
Ponyo is a 2008 Studio Ghibli movie about a little girl, who is, not shitting you, a fish. I know that the Irish bloke is in it, uhh, what's he called... uhh, he was in
Taken... shit, what's his name? Liam.... Liam, uh. Liam Neeson! There we go, I got it. Wait, was was I talking about? Oh yeah, the film. So, the girl is a fish, like
a <i>fish</i>. Her Mum is also a fish, but her Dad AKA Liam Neeson is like a God-human, it's really weird as the Mum is like 100 feet tall, so like, does that mean
that the Dad has a <a href="http://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/my_kind.html">macrophilia fetish</a> or like, what?
<P>
Number VIII<br />
<i>Uhhhhh</i>, God, I don't know, fuck it, I'll do what 'Watchmojo' did! At number 8 it's Fairy Tail!<br />
I've never seen this cartoon so... okay... right, as I'm too lazy, I'll just copy what Wikipedia said about it;
<P>
Fairy Tail (Japanese: &#x30D5;&#x30A7;&#x30A2;&#x30EA;&#x30FC;&#x30C6;&#x30A4;&#x30EB; Hepburn: Fear&#x12B; Teiru) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hiro Mashima. It has been published in Weekly Sh&#x14D;nen Magazine since August 2, 2006, and has been published by Kodansha in 58 tank&#x14D;bon volumes; the individual chapters are being published in tank&#x14D;bon volumes by Kodansha, with the first released on December 15, 2006, and the 58th volume released on November 17, 2016. Fairy Tail follows the adventures of Natsu Dragneel, teenage wizard (&#x9B54;&#x5C0E;&#x58EB; mad&#x14D;shi),[2] who is a member of the popular wizards' guild Fairy Tail, as he searches for the dragon Igneel.
<P>
The manga has been adapted into an anime series produced by A-1 Pictures and Satelight, which began broadcasting in Japan on October 12, 2009.[3] Additionally, A-1 Pictures and Satelight have developed seven original video animations and an animated feature film, Fairy Tail the Movie: Phoenix Priestess. The series ended its initial run on March 30, 2013.[4] A new series premiered on TV Tokyo on April 5, 2014, and ended on March 26, 2016.[1]
<P>
Number VII<br />
Spirited Away is a Studio Ghibli movie about a girl who goes to, I think it's a hotel or something for like ghosts 
and, well, have you ever seen Hotel Transylvania? It's like that, but less funny. To be honest Hotel Transylvania is
better than Spirited Away, for one, it's Adam Sandler, and he's always funny. Second, Adam Sandler is Dracula, and Dracula
is a lad.<img src="/library/img/ash.png" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
<P>
Number VI<br />
Internet Explorer Tan, is a movie made by Microsoft in 2013 for Anime Festival Asia, the movie is odd because the only people
who use IE are wankers who can't install Chrome or FireFox. For some reason Microsoft named IE Tan, so her real name is "Inori Aizawa", I
have no fucking clue what that means. If you do know, please email me at idontgiveashit@gmail.com
<P>
Number V<br />
Akira is one of the best- ah, only joking! Akira is shit. Really long, and shit. The only reason why it's on this list is because everyone fucking dies at the end. To be honest, I did buy this movie on DVD at HMV or CEX, it cost me like 15 quid, Jesus, if it was up to me it would be free because of how shit it is. And it's like 3 hours long, fucking Hell, 3 hours. It went on for <i>waayyy</i> too long, I could have watched Adam Sandler's hit 2011 movie, <i>Jack and Jill</i> in that time.
<P>
Number IV<br />
K-On is a show that I have not the time to watch, I will one day. from the look of it, it's about a school girl who's 14, I've
seen up to like 5 minutes of the show. A friend at my college really likes it and I was like "Sure, I'll watch it". I did watch the dub, for two reasons, one I can't read, I can write, but not read, two English dubs are always better. Always. I should really watch the shows I talk about.
<P>
Number III<br />
Pok&eacute;mon is a show I have not seen nor do I want to. I do know everyone gets hard over thinking about it, so, as a sellout, I'll put it here at number 3.
So, it's about a boy who I think is... 11? Called Ash and like he has a Pok&eacute;mon called <a href="http://owlman.neocities.org/OwlMan/Pikachu.html">Pikachu</a> who everyone loves. I know
that they made that game of the same name. Yep.<br />
Oh! Yeah, crap, yeah, I have watched Pok&eacute;mon, I saw an episode called <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/599131">Pikachu on Acid</a>, it's weird 
that a kids show has drug use in it. The soundtrack for Pok&eacute;mon is quite call as well.
<P>
Number II<br />
Fuck, I don't know what to put here. Ah, One Punch Man is about a bloke who can punch shit 'n' stuff. The only reason why I know
about this is because of Yandere Simulator and- Hey, that can be number 1!
<p>
Number I<br />
Yandere Simulator is a game where you kill people! On a side note, Oka Ruto is the best character if you say anything bad about her, well, I can't do shit as I
don't know anything about you.
<P>
If you liked this list, please tell everyone you know about it, tell people you see on the street, on the tube, on Myspace, on Newgrounds, tell <i>that one guy</i> you
know who you like, but he keeps on telling off colour jokes and spends way too much time on weird subreddits. You know the guy.
<P>
That was a shit list, God, I hate Anime.
