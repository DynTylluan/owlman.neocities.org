<P>
During World War II the British, with help from Guy Maunsell, constructed Sea Forts on the 
East-Soth of England to try and stop  the Germans from invading the UK, <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/clive/ttuc.html#However">however</a> because 
mainland Britan was never invaded they were never used (Side note, the last time Britan 
was invaded was in 1066 by the Norman-French army).
<P>
In 1956 the forts were abandoned because they had ran out of use for the Royal Navy, <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/clive/ttuc.html#However">however</a> 
in 1966 they were operated by Radio Caroline's Ronan O'Rahilly<img src="/library/img/SEEFLAG.png" width="200" height="150" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
and Radio Essex's Paddy Roy Bates.
<P>
<a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/clive/ttuc.html#However">However</A>, after disagreements, Roy Bates seized the tower as his own. O'Rahilly attempted to 
storm the fort in 1967, but Roy Bates defended the fort with guns and petrol bombs and 
continued to occupy the fort.
<P>
The British Royal Marines went on alert and the British ordered Roy Bates to surrender. 
In his refusal, Roy Bates founded the Principality of Sealand on the 2nd of September 1967.
Sealand even say that they are a "independent Sovereign Nation. Established on a wartime 
fortress in 1967 by Prince Roy of Sealand."
