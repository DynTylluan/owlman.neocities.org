Description\Story       : OK, here goes:  After defeating the demons on
                          Earth, you learn of a new terror. Phobos, where
                          this hellish battle all began, has been taken over
                          again! When you were fighting hell on Earth, the
                          demon back-up crew decided to pay a visit to Phobos
                          again. No problem, right? All the installations
                          where already destroyed by you and the first attack
                          right? Yeah, that parts right, but half the
                          surviving humans from earth took refuge there!
                          We just re-did the structures to fit our needs,
                          and moved in again. Bad idea. Those gates were
                          still active. Sooo aah, chalk up another kill for
                          the demons. After the 2nd attack on phobos, only
                          99% of the human population is left. Once you
                          emerged from hell, you took the first ship you
                          could to phobos. Once again, there were no
                          survivors. Now its PAYBACK TIME! Those godamned
                          alien bastards are gonna get one helluva BFG blast
                          up their FREAKIN ASS! You land on the other side
                          of phobos. Where the humans landed for the 2nd
                          time. Your mission is to destroy the 2 main gates,
                          and destroy the platoon of demons at the main
                          teleporter from phobos to Earth. Use the maps,
                          you'll need them to find all the hidden secrets and
                          doors. Beware of the 2 gates, the ARE still active,
                          and more demons might come through any second.
                          The platoon guarding the teleporter out is VERY
                          large, so beware. Good luck marine, and dont forget,
                          KILL 'EM AAAAALLLL!!!!!
