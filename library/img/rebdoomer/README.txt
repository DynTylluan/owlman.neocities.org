Eric Harris Doom Mods

Part I: Intro
Part II: FAQ
Part III: File Info
********************************************************************************

It would seem that Eric Harris was a fan of the kick-arse game known as DOOM, he
was such a big fan infact he even made his own mods for the it. Most of the
mods here are... well crap.

The only mod worth your time playing is UACLABS as it is somewhat fun to play.

Of cause, this does not excuse what Harris and Klebold did to Columbine High
School, nothing ever will, but it is also important not to blame video games or
that of id software. Doom was one of the most played games in the 90's, more
people had Doom than that of Windows 3.1 and that's for no reason, Doom
was - and still is - a very fun game to play, even after 20 years, so because
of this, of cause Eric Harris would have played it, it was very popular any
kid in the 90's would love to play Doom.

When it comes down to it, you should keep one thing in mind while playing the
mods here and that's Eric Harris was a killer, you are not.
Let's get one thing straight, if you're going to kill someone, you're going to
do it and no video game, no music and no book will change your mind.

Blaming video games like Grand Theft Auto for the death of people is wrong.
Blaming music like Marilyn Manson or Judas Prest is wrong.
Blaming books like A Clockwork Orange is wrong.

It is not the media who is to blame here, it is the people who carried out the
act.

And one last thing, if *you* the person reading this feels unsure about playing
the mods here, don't. No one will blame you if you don't play them.

FAQ for Doom

Q: Wait, what is a wad?
A: A WAD stands for 'Where's All the Data?' and is used by games that use the
Doom engine. Most Doom mods will use .WAD and not say .EXE

Q: How do I play WAD files?
A: If you are using Windows then it is quite ease to run. All you need to do is
download softwhere to play them, the most common are ZDoom (zdoom.org),
GZDoomand (gzdoom.drdteam.org) and QZDoom (qzdoom.drdteam.org).

From playing Doom a lot, I would pick QZDoom (Don't worry, their all shareware). 
You will also need a copy of DOOM II, you can get a copy from
Steam, the id softwhere website - and if you're too much of a cheepskate you
can get a warez copy.

Q: Should I use DoxBox?
A: No. QGDoom. Use it.

Q: I don't have Windows, I have [enter what computer you use here]
A: If you don't have a Windows computer then it may be a pain in the arse to get
WAD files to run. Your best bet is to look on line. If your unawhere, there is 
a saying that Doom can run on anything, so unless you have a rock as a
computer, there is still hope yet!

Q: What's the copyright on the mods in this file?
A: For as far as copyright goes, you can distribute the mods, you can't put them
on the Internet (as Harris says) and you can't use the map as a base. 
But as Eric Harris is dead I can only guess the copyright goes to the Harris
family.

Q: Is it true Eric made a mod of his school?
A: No. This is not true, the Doom edating softwhere in the late 90's was crap.

Q: Did Dylan Klebold ever make any Doom mods?
A: Not as far as I know.

Q: Did Eric ever make anymore mods?
A: Yes, he did. If you look around in the READMEs you would of seen he said
about an "awesome multi-level PATCH, REALDOOM". The only way of getting this mod
would of been by emailing rebldomakr@aol.com or rebdoomer@aol.com. But since
Harris is dead, there is no way of getting said mod - unless someone has a copy
of it.

Harris also made a WAD called "Thrasher", but just like REALDOOM, it is lost to
time.

Q: Can I distribute this folder/ZIP?
A: Yes, yes you can.
