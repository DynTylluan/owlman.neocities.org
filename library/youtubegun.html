On Monday the 26th of June 2017, 19-year-old YouTuber, Monalisa Perez (right) shot and killed 
her 22-year-old boyfriend, Pedro Ruiz III, over what has
been called as a stunt to get more YouTube views.
<P><img src="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/monalisa_perez_1.png" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
The stunt, that was filmed in front of family and friends, had Pedro Ruiz to hold 
an encyclopaedia to his stomach while Monalisa would fire a .50-caliber Desert 
Eagle 30.48 Centimetres away from the book. The idea was that the book would 
stop the bullet from hurting Pedro.
<P>
Of cause, the stunt was a total failure, not only did the bullet pass through the book but it also passed into Pedro.
<P>
Perez, who is said to be seven months pregnant with the couple's second child, called 911 on 
Monday evening, saying she had accidentally shot her boyfriend in the chest while they were 
making a video, according to the arrest report. Paramedics on the scene said Ruiz died from 
a single gunshot wound to the chest.
<P>
Perez was arrested and charged with reckless discharge of a firearm, plus is being 
charged with second-degree manslaughter. Perez could face up to 10 years in jail and 
a fine of up to $20,000 if she is convicted of the manslaughter charge against her. 
She has been released on bail and as a condition of her release, she cannot possess 
firearms, she needs to notify her attorney of her whereabouts and has to wear a GPS 
monitor, according to court documents.
<P>
She will be back in court on the 5th of July 2017.  
<P>
On the day of the shooting Monalisa Perez tweeted...
<P>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Me and Pedro are probably going

<P>
Let us see what the kind people at Twitter have to say about this whole ordeal...
<P>
<a href="https://twitter.com/WightSpaceShow/status/880136769588547584">wightspace</a> writes in and says;
<P>
<tt><blockquote>
How could you possibly not have the simplest of foresight to at least test to see if the bullet would go through the book first?  Wow.
</tt></blockquote>
<P>
<A HREF="https://twitter.com/RegularJoel/status/880235455438090240">Joel Cook</a> here seems to want someone who is suspected with second-degree manslaughter to be set free, writes;
<tt><blockquote>
He's dead, she killed him what more is there to say?  Putting her in jail doesnt do anything but ruin the kid's life.
</tt></blockquote>
<P>
And lastly, <a href="https://twitter.com/Hentail_/status/880274459390869505">Hentail</a> writes;
<tt><blockquote>
The book wasn't thicc enough
</tt></blockquote>
<P>
It's quite amazing what people will do for the sake of becoming famous.
