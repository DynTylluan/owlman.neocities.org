It was a very hot day when i was in town, it was a old town with old buldings that looked very old, i went 
into a pornshop and i saw a my little pony vhs, thuis was odd as my little pony had never been on vhs as it 
was only made in 20010.<img src="http://owlman.neocities.org/library/story/img/mlpatdoated.png" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
<P>
I buy the dvd, i look at it, on it it was written "My Litle Pony and the death of all the evil discord", 
it was odd becaued it was written in a marker penn i buy it for 19$ 99p
<P>
when i get home i put the vhs in my dvd player, it play, on the dvd there was a static image off Apple 
Jack standing up, she was looking at me, she had hyper realistic eyes and were red!!!
<P>
Apple jack had a night in his hand, she also had to say "Helo dave, how is u?"
<P>
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH said i as i said ah, how did aj, a background 
pony, know my name and how old i was?
<P>
I called my room mate to come in, he got a crited bat in her hands and smashed the Vhs to bits, No more i say!
<P>
But i was to late the vhs was smashed in to 10000000 peaced
<P>
