The three fillyies sat by the typewriter trying to think of something to write for 
their school newspaper.</br>
They had been sitting their for some time now and not one letter was typed on there
yet
<P>
"I have no ideas fo' what ta' write" said Apple Bloom
<P>
"Why don't we just make something up?" Scootaloo said
<P>
Suddenly Sweetie Belle (Who may I say is best CMC) said out of no where "01001001 
00100000 01110011 01101000 01101111 01110100 00100000 01001010 01000110 01001011"
<P>
"Well we can't put that in the paper!" said Scootaloo
<P>
"I know what I'll do" said Apple Bloom "I'll write somthin' about how Pinkie
Pie killed that guy last week"
<P>
"01010010 01001001 01010000 00100000 01000011 01101000 01101001 01101110 
00101101 01000011 01101000 01101001 01101110" said Sweetie Belle
<P>
"I know THERE was blood everywhere" Scootaloo replied</br>
***
<P>
The girls soon started to write down their article on how Pinkie Pie killed the Dark Lord 
in cold blood; The night soon turned into the day when the girls submitted their work to 
the school newspaper, the girls were really proud of what they wrote
***
<P>
Sadly for the girls Pinkie Pie's lawyer was not too happy about what they wrote about 
her, so the girls soon got their arse sued
