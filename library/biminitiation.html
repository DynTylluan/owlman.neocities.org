Made in 1931 by Fleischer Studios, <i>Bimbo's Initiation</i> is damn right bizzar, if I had no 
imagination I would say something on the lines of "Woah man, this carton is so weird, they must 
of been on, like, weed or shrooms when they made this!"
<P>
To quote <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItWasntMadeOnDrugs">TV Tropes</a>;
<P>
<tt><blockquote>
Any work whose creation seems to have involved large amounts of hallucinogens, 
cocaine, crack, or any other illicit substance that makes people think really 
weird ideas are also really good ones. The plot hinges on bizarre transformations, 
freakish-looking creatures, and nonsensical actions that only seem to make sense in 
realms of logic far removed from your own. That it was the product of a deranged 
mind looks like a foregone conclusion.
<P>
And then you find out that it most certainly wasn't.

<P>
At the start you would have seen a certain <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/cannibalmouse.html">mouse</A>, well this was a lawyer-friendly cameo from Mickey Mouse. 
<P>
Also; Back in the 1930s, "Bimbo" was slang for "tough guy".
<P>
Have a nice day and or night.
