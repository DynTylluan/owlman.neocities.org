Hello there my fellow Americans!
<P>
Don't you just love guns? Guns are

In the news today a man pulled a gun on a group of youths 
when they were playing with Nerf&trade; guns.
<P>
In the video posted online, a woman seems to be pissed 
off because the teens kept on playing with the toy guns 
and, to show who's "b0ss" she points a real gun at them 
telling them to stop their shit.
<P>
Luckily for us, the one kid filmed a very nice video 
showing the Mexican standoff...

After the video was taken, Edina Police Chief David Nelson said 
local police responded to the scene and "spoke to all parties 
involved." No arrests were made and the investigation findings 
have been turned over to prosecutors. 
<P>
My comments are shit to that of Facebook users...

Looks like the "poor, misunderstood youth" was charging 
at them when he pulled the gun. If you don't want to meet 
violence, don't act violent and attack people left and 
right, a lesson that African American youth in America 
apparently have a hard time learning.

The very nice looking <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KevinSGreen">Kevin Green</a> says;

A legitimate self defence scenario. And it worked out very well. 
To call them kids ignore the fact of things like "the knockout 
game" where it is accepted in some quarters to assault and or 
sucker punch people usually black on white crime. You do not 
have to wait until you are assaulted These so called children 
are no different then a criminal street gang having the clear 
potential to cause severe injury or death. For self defence you 
have to be squeaky clean having in no way contributed to the 
arguments escalation into violence. That means you cant start 
a fight or join in a fight then when losing resort to deadly 
force. Calling someone a name does not legally entitle the 
recipient to resort to violence and assault someone. So I can 
pretty much claim this was a legitimate self defence scenario. 
A very good example of a concealed carrier protecting himself 
and herself . People die from getting punched whether you want 
to believe that it was a child or not. No ages were given.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/oldskoolchuk">Chuk Vahl</a> knows what's up;
<P>
<tt><blockquote>
I think we need to underline that conceal and 
carry is a thing. Period. Guns aren't going 
anywhere any time soon.
<P>
So, carry yourself with more class and nobody 
will ever have a chance to debate whether or not 
you deserved to get killed over that dumb shit you did. 
<P>
Also, some people just never give a shit about 
anyone but themselves until the gun comes out. 
As such, let's be careful who we assign innocence 
to. It seems none of these kids ever learned any 
self discipline, they never learned respect for 
themselves, or others; thusly, they deserve no 
respect. Closer into the city and they might have 
run into someone volitile enough to do something 
much worse than brandish a gun... but they knew 
they were in an area where they could disrespect 
people and not catch a beatdown, this makes them 
cowards as well. Let's see them act like that 
over in North or South Minneapolis...
<P>
Everyone just calm down.

That's the whole story sumed up...
