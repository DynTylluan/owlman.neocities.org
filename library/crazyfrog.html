So, two Judas Priest Fans <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/jpfcs.html">commit suicide because of a songs</a>, Weird Al 
<a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/al.html">does a song about
wanking</a> and some guy names his band "<a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/kunt.html">Kunt and the Gang</a>" - that ain't shit compared to
the Swedish Eurodance band <i>Crazy Frog</i>.
<P>
<i>Yeah... okay, I was just joking about the first part...</i>
<P>
You see that little shit on the left? I fucking hate that frog, I can tell you for a full <b><FONT COLOR="RED"><blink>FACT</blink></FONT COLOR></B> that I never
liked the fucking Crazy Frog. Even as a little shit he was a pain in my arse.
<IMG SRC="https://web.archive.org/web/20170413021058/http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v173/sjoko/zfg.gif" alt="The Crazy Cunt" width="234" height="351" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
<P>
Here is a shite history of the little shit.
<P>
Some time in <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/voteforweirdal97/">1997</A> Swedish actor and playwright Erik Wernquist made the mistake of
marketing the little shit to that of ringtone provider Jamba! (later known as Jamster). The animation was originally created to 
accompany a sound effect produced by Daniel Malmedahl in 1997 while attempting to imitate the sound of a two-stroke engine.
<P>
Sometime in like 2006 he did a shitty remix of <i>Axel F</i>. <!-- Fuck you for looking at the code -->
<P>
and....
<P>
Oh fuck it.
<P>
I really fucking hate that frog.
<P>
Also, on his shitty <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Crazy-Frog/108118055875229">Facebook page</A> the "Related Pages" are great;
<ul>
<li>PornTube
<li>French sex pictures
<li>Prolapsus anal
<li>Nude photography
<li>Adolf Hitler
</ul>
<p>
And before you go "Oh Clive, it's based on stuff you look at!"
<P>
Fuck off, I don't even use Facebook.
<P>
What was I doing? Oh fuck, the shit article - yeah, yeah - uh, fuck you, just read the Wikipedia page on the frog.
<P>
I can't be bothered to write about the blue shit. Right now I have a headake, I feel sick and fuck you.
<P>
I don't care about writing this. I won't even archive it, you can archive it if you like but I have better things to do.
<P>
