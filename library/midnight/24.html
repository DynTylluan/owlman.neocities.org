So, because I put my E-Mail address out on the Web for all to see, I get some spam 
E-Mails now and then, most of them are people pretending to be companies I don't 
use saying that I need to collect a parcel I didn't order. But every now and then 
I find a gem like this E-Mail claiming to be a Spanish business tycoon who has 
found my E-Mail and has decided that they want to scam me. 
<P>

you and others too.

God, it would be really weird if the letter 
sent was the real deal and it <b>really</b> was from 
Amancio Ortega Gaona, who had found my website 
and decided that a guy who fetishised 
<a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/rotten.html">Rotten Dot Com</a>, who wrote shitty 
<a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/story/">My Little Pony</a> stories and made a 
<a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/comic/comic/3/">shitty webcomic</a> deserved some of his money. How kind.
<P>
Since we're here, I might as well show you some other spam I get~

Dear Driver,</br>
This is the automatic informational message of the Parking Service.
<P>
Road cameras have recorded the limit exceeding of your automobile. Due to that, you will have to pay the corresponding fine.
<P>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---
<P>
To successfully complete the payment, you will have to document the invoice on the official website. 
<P>
Your Fine Invoice ID is [<i>Removed</i>]
<P>
Please submit it here: [<i>A link that is not recognised by any government body</i>]
<P>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---
<P>
Then, you will receive all required details to execute the payment.</br>
You have one day to finalize the fine. Alternatively, significant charges may apply.</br>
Please do not reply to this message.
<P>

Kindest Regards,</br>
Parking Service

It's always nice to see people thinking that I'm an American and a bad 
driver - well, that last part is true, but not the first - it's also nice 
to see that the Parking Service is checking up on people exceeding the speed limit.
<P>
Anyway, this last E-Mail is my personal favourite, I'll let it speak for itself;
