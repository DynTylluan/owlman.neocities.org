Why do you have to die to be a hero? 
It's a shame a legend begins at its end. 
Why do you have to die if you're a hero 
When there's still so many things to say unsaid?

Hello there guys and gals, it is your BFF, OwlMan 
(and if the voices get too strong I will soon be a
DeadMan) here to talk about why the 
Hell I haven't updated this part of the site in 
a very long time!
<P><img src="/library/midnight/img/1495615956156.jpg" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
Well, simply put, I have two lives; the online 
world where I can be whoever I want to be and the 
real world where I have deeds to do. As of late the 
real world, as it were, has become very busy with 
important things I need to do. This is why in part, 
I haven't uploaded a real long article for about a 
month or so.
<P>
Anyway! You more than likely don't give one shit 
about my boring real life!
<P>
So, what should I talk about on this page? Oh, I 
know.
<P>
What do you think happens when you die? Is there 
a god looking down? Is there a Hell?
<P>
What do I think?
<P>
I'll tell you what happens when you die, you 
become worm meat.
<P>
Is there a god? <i>Is Father Christmas real?</i>
<P>
Is there a Hell? If there is I'm going there.
<P>
I was thinking the other day about how many people 
follow this site on Neocities, like, why follow <i>my</i> 
site? All of my work is flat and boring, how on 
Earth anyone would want to follow <i>me</i> is crazy, but 
thank you anyway!
<P>
Anyway, I love you and if I don't post past Friday 
you know what happened.
<P>
