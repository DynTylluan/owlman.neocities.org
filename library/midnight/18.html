<TABLE WIDTH=750><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<P>
Hello there everyone, Clive here. I am writing this to inform you that I have decided to stop
using <a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a> for a number of reasons. I know that you're all very sorry and upset to see 
your favourite site, owlman.neocities.org, leaving
but I feel like I am wasting my own time on this site if I stay any longer.
<p>
I will be deleting this website by the 20th of August <script type="text/javascript">var year = new Date();document.write(year.getFullYear());</script> 
and I will be moving my site to the super web host, <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix.com</a>, where I will be free of any criticism 
simply because there is no community (more on that later).
<p>
I would thank people like <a href="https://jakeonline.neocities.org/">Jake Online</a>, <a href="https://kratzen.neocities.org/">Froge</a>, 
<a href="https://strata.neocities.org/">strata</a> and I guess more people for being kind and warm spirited, but I dislike all 
of you and hope to never speak to any of you people again ever in my life. So that's that.
<p>
I wanted to inform you all why I have chosen to leave this Hell hole of a web host, so here I go...
<p>
<h1>Reasons Why I'm Quitting...</h1>
<p>
1. There is no FTP uploading. I'm not joking, no FTP. If you haven't ever used Neocities, you probably won't be 
wondering, "SO THEN ALMIGHTY CLIVE FORWARD SLASH OWLMAN, HOW THE FLIP DO YOU UPLOAD YOUR FILES TO NEOCITIES THEN?" Well, you need 
to <b>DRAG AND DROP</b> all of your files and folders to the site to upload them. 
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST, WHAT IS THIS, THE STONE AGE? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? As someone who
has a very big website, this has become a problem because I like to move my files around 
all of the time just to mess with people. I know that you can
delete files and folders, but that's too hard. SO FUCK YOU NEOCITIES FOR NOT HAVING FTP! Cunts.
<p>
2. The community is cancer. Despite that Neocities is a website host first and a community 
second and that I can turn off people writing on my wall, I dislike the community because 
most websites are GAY vapewave sites, DUMB kids and worst of all there are people who support 
Trump. Fuck off. What I find to be the worst thing about the community is the lack of minion 
websites. I have searched all around for minion sites and found NOTHING. Come on guys, bring 
your game up.
<p>
3. You're doing Neocities wrong. That's right, whenever I see a website that looks like it was made in the 90's my blood boils so much. Why can't
you people see that Neocities is not your Geocities renaissance? Are you all brain dead or something? I wish people could build websites as good as 
<a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/14jammar/">mine</a>, but
I guess you can't all be blessed.
<p>
4. Neocities is slow. Just because I live in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England">middle of nowhere</a>, 
have a slow Internet connection, use Windows 95 and use IE, the website Neocities is slow. This is not on. Why should 
it be <i>me</i> who needs to get a better computer made in this century? Don't they know that I use Windows 95 + IE for the 
nostalgia reasons? <i>(Even tho I was born in 2007)</i>
<p>
<h1>Conclusion...</h1>
<p>
Fuck the police coming straight from the underground a young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown and not the other color so police think
they have the authority to kill a minority.
<p>
Fuck that shit, cause I ain't the one for a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun to be beating on, and thrown in jail 
we can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell, fucking with me cause I'm a teenager with a little bit of gold and a pager 
searching my car, looking for the product
thinking every nigga is selling narcotics.
<p>
You'd rather see, me in the pen than me and Lorenzo rolling in a Benz-o beat a police out of shape and when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
to tape off the scene of the slaughter still getting swoll off bread and water.
<p>
I don't know if they fags or what
search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts
and on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none
but don't let it be a black and a white one
bause they'll slam ya down to the street top
black police showing out for the white cop.
<p>
Ice Cube will swarm on ANY motherfucker in a blue uniform just cause I'm from, the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me!
<p>
HUH, a young nigga on the warpath and when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
of cops, dying in L.A. yo Dre, I got something to say
