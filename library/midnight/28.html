Oh my goodness, it's snowing over here in jolly 'ol England for the first time in about a year or so! Rather being trapped inside all day, wanking to <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/amiafurry/index.html">yiff</A> and <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/my_kind.html">ASCII pr0n</A> (<i>only the best for me!</i>) I decided to go outside with me two dogs (Albert and Rue) to see what the weather was outside!
<P>
<tt><center>
So then, here is the first photo taken by me Mum of lovely Rue, admittedly this was taken on the 9th (<i>and not the 10th</i>), but still, a nice photo.

This photo was taken off the path, it seems that some people have been here before us...
<P>

<P>
Oh golly gee, it looks like we found the field that we're going to fuck around on!
<P>
<img src="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/midnight/img/snow_101217/3.png">
<P>
Yep, nothing much to say about this one, only just "hey, it's more snow, how cool yeah"
<P>

<P>
Don't you just love snow?
<P>

Here is another photo of Rue, this time by my Dad's legs!!
<P>

<P>
Once again, you can see my Dad's legs. This is the first photo that Albert is in (yeah, he needs to wear some layers because he's a spaz), also Rue seems to be winking ;3
<P>

<P>
More of Rue and Albert, who seems to be eating some of the snow... okay.
<P>

What's this <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/clive/ttuc.html#Wanker">wanker</A> doing then?
<P>

Final photo (<i>Thank God!</i>) of a canal bridge, I showed my sister this photo and to quote her it looks "quite nice", thanks sis!
<P>

<P>
Overall, it was quite a nice walk in the snow, but I'm very happy to be inside a nice warm house with a fire! Jolly good old chap!

Hope you like the pics Archie and Ben!
