<TABLE WIDTH=750><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<P>
On the 23rd of September I made the horrible misake of deciding to do an AMA (<i>Ask Me Anything</i>) on the UK and British culture. On the 
<a href="https://surl.neocities.org/4JXwW6.htm">AMA page</A> I said that "[You are] free to ask about Brexit, Royalty, how often I masturbate, the 
government, an average day, you know, boring shit like that!"
<P>
So, as I said, here are my answers to all of the questions asked towards me...
<P>
<tt>
<font color="pink">A.N. Lucas Asked:</br>
How often do you master bait</font color>
<P>
<font color="gold">OwlMan's Answer:</br>
I guess I put this question on myself, if you <i>really</i> want to know, I do it once every hour and for a bonus answer, I do it
over a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19tq3-fSnbA">pornographic polaroid of an ex-girlfriend who died</a> :-(</font color>
<P>
<font color="pink">strata Asked:</br>
1) Your opinion on the Hulme Crescents? As a Briton, do you also find them terribly ugly?</br>
2) I need to know if Wallace &amp; Gromit excessively exaggerates british cosiness or if you really still have flower patterns on your walls and rockets in the basement.</br>
3) How does it feel to live in a nation that's #1 in exporting reality shows?</br>
4) How often do you masturbate?</br>
5a) Is the weather in the UK really as shitty as everybody in the world says?</br>
5b) Is it a little better in Brighton?</br>
5c) Is Brighton a place worth living? I heard Big Beat was invented there. Also, Cyriak lives in Brighton.</br>
6a) On a scale from 1 (not at all) to 10 (very), how patriotic are you?</br>
6b) Would you be more patriotic if every town was replaced with Brighton?</br>
7) How shocked were you when finding out that Rockstar North was not an American game developer and based in Scotland instead?</br>
8) Ever been to other countries? Wales doesn't count.</br>
9) *obligatory average day question*</br>
10) Is it me or is Britpop extremely boring?</br>
11) Your opinion on The Office UK?</br>
12a) What about public surveillance that the UK loves that much? Do you like it?</br>
12b) Is it everywhere as extreme as in London?</br>
13) Would you forgive me if I said I was sorry for these dumb questions?</font color>
<P>
<font color="gold">OwlMan's Answer:</br>
1) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulme_Crescents">Hulme Crescents</a> was demolished in 1994, so before my time. But I'll say that I dislike the majority of buildings made in the 60's, most of them are square and LEGO-like</br>
2) <i>Wallace &amp; Gromit</i> doesn't really exaggerate British cosiness, for example, some people (e.g. myself) still have Flying Wall Ducks on their walls, but not so many people have flower pattern wallpaper today, shame too, I quite like the look of it and yes, everyone has a rocket in their basement</br>
3) No-one I know likes that shit</br>
4) A lot</br>
5a) The weather is quite nice in the UK, it hardly ever rains. Because it's becoming winter, it's getting darker earlier and I like that :-)</BR>
5b) I've never been to Brighton, so I don't know</br>
5c) I don't know, just ask Cyriak</br>
6a) I'm really not that patriotic to be fair, from 1 to 10, I'd say 4</br>
6b) YES!</br>
7) I always knew that Rockstar was from the UK, so I wasn't shocked at all</br>
8) Yes, I've been to France, Poland, Germany (great place) and Spain</br>
9) *obligatory average day answer*</br>
10) I like some Britpop bands, like Blur and Oasis, but I don't go out of my way to play any of that type of music</br>
11) I've never seen The Office UK or US, but because I am British I ultimately prefer the UK one</br>
12a) I wish that people would just fuck off and stop watching other people</br>
12b) When I was in London I didn't really notice any CCTV</br>
13) You don't need to be sorry for anything, I put this pain on myself, <i>woe is me</i></font color>
<P>
<font color="pink">jakeonline Asked:</br>
Why doesn't the UK have those overused sound effects in TV shows like Kitchen Nightmares? Not only that, but what do you think about it?
<P>
Examples:</br>

<P>
<font color="gold">OwlMan's Answer:</br>
Weird that you should ask that, only last night (the 22nd) I found this post on 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK">/r/CasualUK</a> talking about 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/6s6xh3/english_vs_american_kitchen_nightmares_xpost/">English vs. American Kitchen Nightmares</a>. 
I think there is such a difference because American's do know what <i>subtlety</i> is. Oh, and what do I think about it? It's kind of funny, to be honest. 
<P>
<font color="pink">jakeonline again Asked:</br>
Do you on the same level of politicalness as the US or do you think they're weird?</font color>
<P>
<font color="gold">OwlMan's Answer:</br>
You can never be too polite!</font color>
<P>
<font color="pink">rocketmix said:</br>
What are some of the things you are jealous about North America?
<P>
<font color="gold">OwlMan's Answer:</br>
American's have Adult Swim</font color>
<P>
jopa Asked:</br>
1) do british people like extreme amounts of gossip? did gossip kill a certain princess on august 31st, 1997?</br>
2) What's up with the walls is belfast? I don't even know the difference between Catholic and Protestant.</br>
3) What is your favorite british food?</br>
4) Why are many .uk domain names .co.uk instead of just .uk?</br>
5) Does the queen have any power over the UK? Or is it now just a symbol/tradition?</br>
6) What do you eat for bwekfast?</br>
7) I will miss you when you're no longer in the European Union. Hopefully, I can still travel with ease to your country! And buy stuff there!</br>
8) Do you like James Bond and Harry Potter?</br>
9) Is there any attention towards the general climate change issue? Is there political consensus? Are there actions?</br>
10) How is the air polution in the UK?</br>
11) Do you like Cricket?</br>
12) Do you like London?</br>
13) What is your favorite geographic place in the UK?</br>
14) Do you like top &amp; fifth gear?</br>
15) Do you like RollerCoaster Tycoon?
<P>
<font color="gold">OwlMan's Answer:</br>
1) I think we all like gossip, that's the reason why <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4meFC1ee7Q">Di</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3adIniQM4Q">died</A></br>
2) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/me_ira/comments/5xr8zk/meira/">me_ira</a>. The tl;dr is how they follow The Bible</br>
3) Fish and chips all the way!</br>
4) I'm not so sure why this is, I guess people were just lazy and couldn't be bothed to just get .uk, saying that, as of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.uk#.UK_Right_of_Registration">2013 you can just get .uk websites, over say .co.uk</a></br>
5) In some sense, the Queen "<i>does</i>" have power over Parliament, but if she exercises any of her powers (i.e. disagrees to put a bill into law) then something bad will probably happen to her - I think. I would recommend watching "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMXJOKhf_AA&list=PLfxy4_sBQdxzZNqvVQXcBPvsl1Zgzy2-q">British politics explained</a>" by Jay Foreman to better understand British politics.
6) In an ideal, world I would eat Weetabiks, but I eat Shredies</br>
7) I'll miss you guys, too. Britain will always be in the EU in my heart &lt;3</br>
8) Yeah I like James Bond and Harry Potter! My sister is Harry Potter mad!</br>
9) There isn't really much going on about climate change right now, I guess that some people are upset about fracking going on in some parts of the country. As for political consensus, I suppose that there is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_(UK)">Green Party</A> (left wing party) who care very much for the Earth</br>
10) The air in the UK is quite nice</br>
11) I don't really care for any sports, let alone cricket</br>
12) Yeah I like London, but I think smaller towns are nicer</br>
13) All of Wales! Such a nice place :-)</br>
14) Top Gear is a great show, I understand why James May and Richard Hammond quit, but did the BBC really need to replace them with Chris Fucking Evens?</br>
