Hello there everyone, it is I, OwlMan King of Neocities, 
here to talk about whatever is on my mind...
<P>
Today I was on YouTube watching Lazy Town maymays when I 
found "The Mine Song" and somehow I found out that there 
was a British English version of it.
<P>
Growing up in the UK I sometimes watched Lazy Town on (I 
think) the channel Nick JR. and later on CBBC. It's weird 
to think that there are two versions of a TV show. For 
some reason, I had forgotten the British version.
<P>
I feel like most people don't give one shit while reading 
this - but look if you did watch Lazy Town at the time and 
grew up in The UK, can you remember the British accents? 
Tell me, I must know!

<h1>The Trap Door</h1>
<P>
Even tho I grew up in the early 2000s my childhood 
was made up of old VHS tapes consisting of old British 
shows from the 1980s. One of my favourite tapes to 
watch was The Trap Door - a show that is very much 
monster-of-the-week but gets away with being boring 
by how fun the show can get.
<P>
About two months ago I rewatched the entire show on 
YouTube and I was unsurprised that it was still good.
<P>
Also, the intro by Zygott kicks arse.
