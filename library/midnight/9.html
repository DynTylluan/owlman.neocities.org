On this day (23rd of April) 1982 the 8-bit home computer known as the ZX 
Spectrum came out in Blighty. The ZX had 16 KB of RAM for &pound;125 or 
with 48 KB for &pound;175; these prices were later reduced to &pound;99 
and &pound;129 respectively
<P>
The computer would become well known in its native land as many people 
were able to buy it - what with its low price.
<P>
The ZX would also be the home of many classic games such as Jet Set 
Willy, Elite, Jetpac, Ant Attack and loads of other games I haven't ever played.
