<P>
Being that I lurk around a lot online, I find some weird shit, 
and that's coming from a guy who's Dark Web name is "<i>xX_big_blond_daddy_Xx</i>" - 
so you know what I found is going to be... <i>interesting</i> to say the least. I 
can't recall how I found this story below, I must have been Googling (I now 
use DuckDuckGo) some weird shit about sex or something like that, anyway, 
this comes from an article called "<a href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/eko-hayden/2015/11/27-people-share-their-partners-kinkiest-fetish-and-whether-they-were-down-with-it-or-not/">
27 People Share Their Partner's Kinkiest 
Fetish And Whether They Were Down With It Or Not</A>" and if you haven't guessed 
it yet, it's going to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tII-tBQODmw">NSFW</A> - so if you're in public or something like that, 
you may wish to bookmark this tab <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/clive/ttuc.html#Wanker">for later</A>.
<P>
Anyhowz, here is the story that I hope will stay in the back of your mind next 
time you go to sleep. :-) 
<P>
<tt><blockquote>
My girlfriend (I'm also a girl) is into eating chocolate out 
of my ass...yep, nothing shit related I always have an enema
and clean my ass thoroughly before. I'm quite open to 
sexual experimentation but this threw me off a little 
at first since it was so... different I guess? I did end 
up doing it and we both loved it so we continued. 
We usually used Kit Kat or Aero since those were 
her favourite bars but decided to buy Oh Henrys this 
time and... uh... don't.
<p>
We did the usual, she played with my ass a little bit
then slid the bars one by one into me, I think we had
four full size bars and eight fun size when she 
decided to start.
<p>
So I began to push but nothing came out... then I 
started bleeding, which happens sometimes but 
usually not in this quantity it then started 
to hurt, usually the bars slide out as easy 
as just taking a shit but this time NOTHING 
was coming out except for a trickle of chocolate
and a lot more blood then there should be.
<p>
We both started panicking thinking what the fuck 
is going on! After ten minutes of hard core pushing 
and pain she could finally see it... a giant fucking 
ball of caramel and pointy peanuts. When I say giant 
I mean fucking huge it was the size of a fucking 
pineapple. It turns out all the caramel and peanuts 
in the bars formed this monstrosity from being shoved 
up and squished, I couldn't even get it out, it was stuck.
<p>
My girlfriend had to shove her fingers into my ass and 
stretch it open to its limits to make this thing even 
move and by this point my ass was profusely bleeding 
because of the pointy peanuts sticking out of the 
ball cutting up my insides.
<p>
After half an hour we finally got it out. It was red 
with blood and I couldn't even fit both hands around 
it. I had to sit on the toilet for a while afterward 
because my anus was still leaking blood everywhere. 
My ass hurt for days after.
<p>
tl;dr - Don't shove caramel and peanut bars up your ass, you'll cry.
