Last night I was surfing Reddit when I came across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Jessicamshannon/">/r/Jessicamshannon</A>, a subreddit that wants the reader to "imagine that the victim is you or your family. Imagine feeling what they feel. I want all of my albums to help make history come alive". When looking at the subreddit, I found a post called "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Jessicamshannon/comments/7b5ylm/wedding_after_the_battle_of_britain/">Wedding after the battle of Britain</A>"; it's quite weird seeing a seemingly normal thing in an abnormal environment. I think these photos speak for themselves.
