Nuts I, II &amp; III are some of the best <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/doom.html">Doom</A> WADs, do you want your computer to goto 2 FPS? Want to be killed by 1000+ monsters?
If you said yes to both... then get help.
Nuts is what it says on the tin, the game is crazy. The only Nuts game that will play okay on my computer is Nuts II
and even then it is still slow.
<P>
Nuts III is where it just gets silly with over Over 12,00 monsters. Good luck not using God Mode!
<P>
What is weird is the story for Nuts:
<P>
<blockquote><tt>
You are assigned to destroy the final Hellspawn
army on Litrivin IV. The government sends you all
alone becuase you got drunk at the General's 
Birthday party last year and he never liked you
since. Since this is the biggest Hellspawn army 
ever esstablished, the cheap-ass General sends 
you with nothing but a pea shooter. Good luck.
