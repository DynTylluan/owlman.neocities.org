Look, I fucking love Doom and you do too unless you've never played it... Even in the year 
<script type="text/javascript">var year = new Date();document.write(year.getFullYear());</script> it's still
fucking great to play, if Doom was a man I would more than happily suck their dick for free.
<P>
I've never been into computer games at all, one of the last games I played was Jet Set Willy in 2009, sure I played lots of flash
games on <a href="http://newgrounds.com/games">Newgrounds</a> and on <a href="http://www.nitrome.com/">Nitrome</A> but never got 
into the game so much that I wanted to write an article about it.
<P>
The first time I played Doom was... well crap, I did not know about all the ports, such as <a href="https://zdoom.org">ZDoom</a>, 
<a href="http://qzdoom.drdteam.org/">QZDoom</a> and even <a href="https://gzdoom.drdteam.org/">QZDoom</a>. No, I used <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/">DosBox</a> to run Doom II. 
This was a bad idea as, well, the game looked like crap, there was no sound at all and the only way to run was by pressing down Shift all the time.

Until I used <a href="http://qzdoom.drdteam.org/">QZDoom</a> I had no idea what I was missing out on. 
Holy crap, the first thing that will hit you will be the music.
Bobby Prince, who worked on a lot of games by id Software and Apogee Software, was really on his game for Doom, from start to finish, 
Doom is full of great metal songs of that era.
Many of the songs were inspired by or <i>closely</i> mirror pop rock and metal songs, from groups like Alice in Chains, Metallica, 
Pantera and Slayer. Call it an inspiration or a homage; you can't tell me you don't love it. One of the highlights for me would be 
the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170221005748/http://www.doomworld.com/3ddownloads/music/doom2end.mp2">Endgame Music</a>.

<h1>Doom II</h1>
<P>
How do you improve a masterpiece? It's very hard to. Is Doom II a masterpiece? 
<i>....no....</i> Doom II is admittedly bigger; bigger maps, more monster and a 
new weapon, but it is sadly not as good as the first. Many of the maps don't 
look like what they're meant to be, an example of this would be the city levels 
that look nothing like a city. 
<P>
Another being monsters, where the monsters in Doom were evenly matched, the 
monsters in Doom II take the piss. Just look at Arch-viles.
<P>
But does Doom II have an upside? Yes. The super shotgun; the lord of all 
weapons, if playing with the normal shotgun was fun, imagine playing with two in one.

<h1>WADs and Mods</h1><IMG SRC="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/doom_ss_21_02_2017_01_16b.png" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
<P>
Here are some Doom WADs I really like and hope you like 'em too;
<ul>
<li>If I've ever seen a joke WAD done well, it's <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom/v-z/yakworld">YakWorld</a>, made in 1994 this mod is somehow fun to play
more than 20 years on.
<li>Doomguy takes some magic mushrooms to relax. <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/vb/wads-mods/74283-shrooms-wad-babys-first-wad-preview-released/">Shrooms</a>. Play it. Best WAD.
<li><a href="https://captain-hawkes.neocities.org/wad/doom.html">Monastery of Apostasy</a> is a fun little WAD that I love to speedrun, check it out
<li><a href="https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/themes/university/trinity2">The Unholy Trinity</a> seems to be one of the first <i>good</i> mods for Doom that aren't  really short in size.
Trinity also had the honour of being named one of <a href="http://www.doomworld.com/10years/bestwads/1994.php">the best 100 WADs for 1994</a>, if being one of the best WADs is
not a good reason to play it, I don't know what is.
<li>Everyone loves <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/trump.html">Donald Trump</a>, <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/clive/ttuc.html#Poe's Law">especially me</a>! So why not play as him in <a href="https://mega.nz/#!C8twCZyb!yfDzaYu9NafZVCl982Y-D66k-873MmIfrt0sU0HnerQ">Trump Doom</a>?
</ul>

Being that Doom was a hit success for id and <i>a lot</i> of people have played it, less have 
made mods for the game, of these people is Eric Harris, one of the two Columbine 
High School shooters. As it turns out, 
<a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/2killers.html#doom">Eric was quite 
the fan of Doom</a>, he even <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/rebdoomer/">made his own mods for the game</a>.
<P>
Most of the mods are... <i>well, bad</i> in a design point of view, the only 
mod worth your time is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170118021345/http://www.geocities.ws/owlman/rebdoomer/uaclabs.zip">uaclabs.wad</a>
<P>
Doom, alongside The Matrix and Marilyn Manson, had the <i>honour</i> of being the blame for 15 (including Harris and 
Klebold) deaths and 24 non-fatal injuries.
