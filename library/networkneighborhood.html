<P>
The 5th of July 2016 was the end of the Network Neighborhood, a <a href="https://neocities.org">Neocities</a> webring that less than 1&#37; of the site was apart of. 
I would say that I had no idea that it was ending, but I knew.
<P>
Lots of its members were leaving the NN like mad, 98plus even said (on his blog) "the webring i'm 
in and co-founded (remember that?) is on the verge of shutting down. yeah. <img src="http://owlman.neocities.org/img/dump/ANInetDeath.gif" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5> the best way we can stay alive if is we get more members." 
Well, they only got one new member.
<P>
What's even more, on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ1JOmu9zc2LtKUaQArjCWg">NN YouTube</a> channel 98plus posted a video (that's now been 
removed [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161220170906/https://my.mixtape.moe/xvrnkr.mp4">archive</a>]) saying the same thing he said on his blog, he also told us that 
"We need new members as soon as possable" and that we <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/w3/nngoogle.html">should apply to join the NN</a>. 
I did apply on the day the video was put on YouTube, the fourth of April, four months 
later and still no reply from them. Jeez.<a href="https://networkneighborhood.neocities.org"><img src="http://owlman.neocities.org/OwlMan/Banners/nneighborhoodsmall.png" align=left hspace=15 vspace=5></a>
<P>
It even got to the point that I went to their Discord server (that is no longer up) and asked why they had not contacted me, this is what they said (two things to note; one I was 17 at the time and two, there was a NN member who was 17 (or even 16) at the time):
<P>
<blockquote><tt>
17th of June 2016</font color><P>
<font color="d73737">Marin the Technomancer:</font color> yeah, we have a general age requirements just because many of 
our members are over 18 and it's just... there can be issues i'd like to adoid.
<p>
<font color="1fad83">OwlMan:</font color> Am I to young then?
<p>
<font color="d73737">Marin the Technomancer:</font color> I don't think so, have you applied @OwlMan
<p>
<font color="1fad83">OwlMan:</font color> I did but the NN never got back
<p>
<font color="d73737">Marin the Technomancer:</font color> Oh. That might have been during my absence, i'll check the applications.
<p>
<font color="1fad83">OwlMan:</font color> Okay :D

<P>
They never got back to me.
