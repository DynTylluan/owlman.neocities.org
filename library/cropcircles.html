There have been many famous hoaxes thru out history such as the War 
of the Worlds ('38), Balloon boy ('09), The Cottingley Fairies (1917) etc.

Probably one of the most well know one are crop circles
<p>
One of the earliest reports of crop circles was on 22nd of August 1678 
from a news pamphlet "The Mowing-Devil: or, Strange News out of 
Hartford-shire" that tells of a farmer in Hertfordshire who will 
not pay for a laborer to mow his field saying that he would rather 
that the Devil mowed it instead.
<p>
As it turns out the Devil was feeling rather nice that night. According to the 
pamphlet, the farmer's field appeared to be on fire. The next day field was 
found to be perfectly mowed, "that no mortal man was able to do the like".
<p>
Of cause the pamphlet is most likely made up, one give away is that it has
no proof at all; Who is the farmer? When did it happen? Where in
Hertfordshire did this happen?
<p>
<blockquote>

<tt>Transcript:<br/>

The Mowing-Devil: Or, Strange NEWS out of Hartford-&#x17F;hire.<br/>
<p>
Being a True Relation of a Farmer, who Bargaining with a poor Mower, about the 
Cutting down Three Half Acres of Oats upon the Mower's asking too much, the 
Farmer &#x17F;wore, 'That the Devil &#x17F;hould Mow it, rather than He.' 
And lo it fell out, that that very Night, the Crop of Oats &#x17F;hew'd as 
if it had been all of a Flame, but next Morning appear'd &#x17F;o neatly 
Mow'd by the Devil, or &#x17F;ome Infernal Spirit, that no Mortal Man was 
able to do the like. Al&#x17F;o, How the &#x17F;aid Oats ly now in the Field, 
and the Owner has not Power to fetch them away.
</tt>

<p>
Despite making crop circle without the landowner's permission is criminal damage
there have only been two cases of someone being charged for criminal 
damage. 
<p>
First in 1992 where two Hungarian youths, Tak&aacute;cs and R&oacute;bert Dallos both 17 had
the honour of being the first two people to be charged with legal action after 
creating a crop circle. Both went to St. Stephen Agricultural Technicum, a 
high school in that funnily enough specialised in agriculture none the less.
<p>
The two guys created a 36-metre crop circle in a field near Sz&eacute;kesfeh&eacute;rv&aacute;r, 7
on 8th of June '92.
The land owners sued the Tak&aacute;cs and R&oacute;bert for 630,000 Hungarian forint -
about $3,000.
<p>
In 2000 Matthew Williams was arrested for causing criminal damage by
making a crop circle near Devizes (the heart of Wiltshire). He was fined the sum
of &pound;100 and &pound;40 for court fees.

of crop circles was in 1991, where
Doug Bower and Dave Chorley calmed that they started the craze of crop circles
in 1978, they said that they made the circles with just a plank of wood, 
some rope, and a baseball cap fitted with a loop of wire to help them walk 
in a straight line.
<p>
To prove that they started the craze, the two men made a circle in front 
of some journalists. Author Pat Delgado examined the circle and said it 
was the real deal. However, it was revealed that it was just a hoax.
<p>
As the times change, so did crop circles. They are no longer a thing for people
to wonder about in awl, instated they are for advertising. Many companies such 
as Hello Kitty, who in 2004 celebrated their 30th anniversary made a crop form
in the shape of Hello Kitty.
