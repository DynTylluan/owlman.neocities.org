Once in a full moon, you find something on the Web that makes you go wonder if you're awake.

According to Best Gore user <a href="http://www.bestgore.com/members/happy/">Vincit Omnia Veritas</a> and <a href="http://www.bestgore.com/members/african-angel/">African Angel</a>, in Mbeya, south-west of Tanzania, 
25-year-old Neemah Machoma was held in a septic tank for two years by her brother who 
reportedly followed the instructions from a witch doctor that if he did so he would 
become rich.
<P>
Nathan Machoma, 35, did apparently become rich, but, putting his sister in a in a 
septic tank for two years is not the reason he became rich.
Nathan Machoma has been arrested.
<P>
He reported his sister missing to the police, but his maid became suspicious about 
his regular visits to the tank and checked what was in it when he was at work.
<P>
Neemah Machoma was severely malnourished and emotionally disturbed but is recovering. 
I haven't included any photos of what she looks like now, but they are quite horrifying 
to see.
<P>
Best Gore user, <i>Vincit Omnia Veritas</i>, seemed to be unsure too whether or not she was 
really there for two years, they said this in the article...
<P>
<blockquote><tt>
Whether she was really in the tank for 2 years, or the media is exaggerating to make 
the story more dramatic, I do not know. Either way, even a day is too long, and 
hopefully that sack of shit who did this to his own sister gets what's coming to him.
