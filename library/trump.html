You know when a joke goes too far, but for some reason, people keep on 
telling that joke, well Donald Trump is that joke.
<P>
The UK is mostly left wing, so unsurprisedly I have a left-wing view of 
the world, much like the rest of the UK and right now we know American 
politics is a mess, even in late October of 2016 we knew you guys were 
fucked; Trump or Hillary? Good God.
<P>
I'm not saying that the UK's politician are better than American ones, 
just look at Nigel Farage or Nick Griffin, but at least we don't make 
them our MP's.
<P>
The last PM to be really hated by the public was Thatcher in 1992, it <img src="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/pink_the_wall.jpg" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
would seem the last joke was Bush. When a politician is going to be a 
negative effect for the country, why would you make him the leader of 
said country?
<P>
It's not his policies that scare me, it's how undertrained and immature 
he is, what with having flamewars over Twitter, mocking a reporter for 
having mental problems, the infamous Trump University. If this was a TV 
show, it would be made fun of because of how unrealistic it is.
<P>
Oh, also for the people who did the whole Not My President protest or 
even the dumb hashtag, did you really think you would achieve anything 
but make fools out of yourselves? I don't like Trump, but I know what a 
democracy is. What is a better way to vote? Having it the way it has been 
where people have ballots or people protest and break shit?
<P>
I really don't know who pisses me off more; Trump or the protesters.
<P>
No really, good job America.

<!-- No shit Neo-Nazis are bad, I'm not six. I know this basic stuff.                                                                                   -->
<!-- What's funny is that when I put the quote in, I knew little about what Antifa was, lul                                                             -->
