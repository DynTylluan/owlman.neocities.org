Born in 1851, Luis Ricardo Falero who, among other things, specialized in 
female nudity, mythological, oriental and

fantasy art. A large majority 
of his paintings contained at least one nude or topless woman.
<P>
Falero was born in Granada, Spain, and would originally pursue a career 
in the Spanish Navy, but he gave it up to his parents' disappointment. 
He would walk all the way to Paris to study art, chemistry and mechanical 
engineering. He would find the experiments he had to conduct in mechanical 
engineering so dangerous that he would decide to focus on painting alone. 
He was a student of Gabriel Ferrier. After Paris, he studied in London, 
where he eventually settled down.
<P>
He would grow a particular interest in astronomy and incorporated 
celestial constellations into many of his art, such as in  Moon Nymph 
(1883). His interest and knowledge of astronomy would also lead him to 
illustrate the works of Camille Flammarion.
<P>
In 1886, the same year of his death, his former housemaid and then 
model, Maud Harvey, sued Falero for paternity. The suit alleged that 
Falero seduced Harvey when she was 17. When he discovered she was 
pregnant, he dismissed her. She won the case and was awarded five 
shillings per week in support of their child.
<P>
Falero died at University College Hospital, London, at the age of 45.
