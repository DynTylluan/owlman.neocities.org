I just love writing about this sort of thing - 
memes that is, I just love to shit on people who 
find them funny. As we all know the only funny 
thing in the world is not memes, but your 
ever-shortening life.
<P>
In the "news" today 9gag - one of the worst websites 
only behind that of this one - buried a meme monument 
for future generations to find. Honestly, I wish I 
could tell you that this is a sick joke, but no, 
they really did it. This is the equivalent of me 
burying the smallpox virus in hopes of people in 
the year 2087 getting it.
<P>
The ugly, waste of money and pointless monument has such great memes like...

Of cause with all of the coverage someone needed to get 
their hands on it - that being 4chan who were able to 
track down where 9gag buried the monument. lets lazily

9gag buried a &quot;meme monument&quot; in an undisclosed location to be 
found by future generations. Since the memes on the monument were utterly 
shit normalfag memes, /pol/ took it upon itself to locate, unearth, and 
deface the monstrosity in Operation Smash The Stone.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WanRFNtFwGI">Video</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/Yq40iv4.jpg">Photo</a> <a href="https://i.imgur.com/0U8wCgN.png">2</a></p>

<p>The sculptor Antonio Soler (seen in above photo) lives in Spain, and 
the truck shown in the video had a Spanish license plate, so that&#39;s 
where the hunt began.</p>

<p>Using Google Maps to line up scenes from the video, as well as 
searching for Limestone quarries near suitable (desert-like) areas 
of Spain, it was determined that the monument lied somewhere in the 
Tabernas desert of Southern Spain.</p>

<p>Autism ensued, and now /pol/ is mobilizing Spainons to commence 
stage 2 of Operation Smash The Stone.</p>

We've yet to find out if 4chan have smashed the monument - 
to be honest, they probably will be able to achieve their 
goal. If they were able to find the 
<i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtsTzTB5cKc">He Will Not Devide Us flag</A></i> 
they will be able to destroy the 9GAG Monument.

God's speed 4chan! God's speed!
