<P>
The year is 2017, <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/trump.html">a man with no past political experience is in the White 
House</a>, some <i>genius</i> at Sony is making an <a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/emojimovie.html">emoji movie</A> and now there is going 
to be a meme festival. No, this is not a sick joke.
<P>
Yes, for just c. 13.86 Dollarydoos you can get a ticket to go on Friday the 
21st of April 2017 at The Colonial Hotel in Melbourne!
<P>
As the Meme Fest writes on their Eventbrite page;
<P><tt><blockquote>
Have you got to get away from your Crazy Girlfriend for the night? Or are 
you just cray cray for Harambe? We are holding a meme fest to celebrate all 
of your beloved memes, from Bad Luck Brian to Success Baby and every meme 
<span style="background-color:ff5555"><span title="Should be &quot;in between&quot; or even &quot;in-between&quot;" style="border-bottom:1px dotted black; cursor:help;">inbetween</span></span>!
<P>
Help celebrate the night by coming dressed up as your favorite meme and 
topping it off with our meme <span style="background-color:ff5555"><span title="One word not two" style="border-bottom:1px dotted black; cursor:help;">cut 
outs</span></span> and face masks! There will also be awesome prizes for the 
best dressed on the night so make sure to channel your inner Yao Ming 
and <span style="background-color:ff5555"><span style="background-color:ff5555"><span title="It's &quot;remember&quot;" style="border-bottom:1px dotted black; cursor:help;">rememeber</span></span></span> to pay attention 
to all the meme visuals! And if <span style="background-color:ff5555"><span title="Worst Mistake here, it needs to be &quot;you're&quot;, or &quot;you are&quot;. Please, this is basic English here." style="border-bottom:1px dotted black; cursor:help;">your</span></span> 
still keen for more memes then look no further than our meme themed 
drinks and free <span style="background-color:ff5555"><span title="Two words" style="border-bottom:1px dotted black; cursor:help;">photobooth</span></span>.
<P>
Hop on down just like Pepe the Frog and spend your night listening to all 
the things Rick Astley is never gonna do and don't forget your sunglasses 
for Take On Me. Be there or Cash Me Ousside Howbow Dah.

<i>Grage C- See me after class</i>
<P>
One thing to point out about the description, <i>apart from the spelling</i>, is 
that they put "get away from your Crazy Girlfriend", yeah, 
I think people who are going to go to <i>Meme Fest</i> don't have girlfriends.
<P>
Yes, it's really happening, honestly, we're not sure if this is an ironic 
thing, or if they're being unironic. All we do know is that you might as 
well burn your money than spend it on this.
<P>
Anyway, my opinion doesn't matter, let's see what the nice people of 
Facebook think about Meme Fest!

Yeyint Aung thinks;

Meanwhile, Nikita Schilke thinks;

NORMIES GET OUT REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!</tt></blockquote>

Last but not least Michael Green says;
<P>
<tt><blockquote>

<P>
theres no way im going to miss this shit
</tt></blockquote>
Thank you veddy much Facebook, let us see what Twitter thinks of Meme Fest...
<P>
@Huxide says;
<P><tt><blockquote>there's a "meme fest" happening in melbourne...</br>
this is so retarded and the news coverage is even worse</br>
it's even organized via facebook
<P></tt></blockquote>
@jevn11 has some words of wisdom;
<P><tt><blockquote>Apparently there's a meme fest coming up. Kill me please!!!
</tt></blockquote>
<P>
And lastly @MrMan9001 says; 
<P><tt><blockquote>#Memefest #Memes Hahaha guys this is great
<P>
God help us all, Australia was a mistake
</tt></blockquote>
<P>
Hahaha! Yes, it sure was a mistake!
<P>
<h1>Update: Was "Meme Fest" Even Real?</h1><p>
<tt><blockquote>16/10/2017</tt></blockquote>
<P>
I feel like I'm missing something, after looking around on the Web for any 
evidence that Meme Fest really took place, I found nothing, it's almost like 
it never happened. There are no articles talking about it happening, there are 
no videos of the event, there are no photos of it, nothing at all - even 
the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/263972334025971/">Facebook page for the event</A> 
goes to a 404 page. Was Meme Fest even a thing, or 
was it like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DashCon">Dashcon</A> and one giant scam?
<P>
If I didn't know better, I would have said that Meme Fest was just a joke that 
got out of hand, but it couldn't have been as the organizers were selling 
tickets <a href="https://archive.is/BLbOD">for money</A> 
for an event at The Colonial Hotel - a hotel that's 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130212195500/http://www.thecolonialhotel.com.au:80/">website 
was made well before <i>Meme Fest</i></a> was known about. I even tried 
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=meme+site%3Athecolonialhotel.com.au&t=ffab&atb=v84-2&ia=web">searching Colonial 
Hotel's website</A> for any information about Meme Fest, but as I expected I found 
nothing. It's weird that an event called "Meme Fest" had no photo/video proof, 
surely someone would have taken some evidence of it happening, but nope, there 
is nothing, it's almost like it never happened.
<P>
Did it even take place? Who knows. Does anyone care? I guess I somewhat do, as I'm 
doing an update to this page and in the past, I have even 
<a href="https://owlman.neocities.org/news.html#30%20April%202017%20@%2014:54%20-%20Design%20Choices%20Exposed">asked for people to contact 
me if they have any information</A>, but alas, nothing has come up
