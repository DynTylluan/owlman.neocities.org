<TABLE WIDTH=750><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<tt>Some links may not work if you're outside of the UK. Sorry.</tt>
<P>
For what it's worth, I have mixed feelings towards the BBC, for 
one they have made some great programs in the past like Doctor 
Who, Top Gear, Have I Got News For You, Bottom and a whole bunch 
of other gems.
<P>
But as of late, the BEEB has been making some truly terrible 
content, like "Things Not To Say To <i>X</i> People", a truly 
mind-boggling web series by BBC 3, where they get a bunch 
of people to pick out a slip of paper from a jar that says 
something corresponding to why they picked said person.
<P>
For example, if they did a video called "Things Not To 
Say To IT People", someone in the video would pick out 
a piece of paper that says something like; "When are 
you going to get a real job?", after this, the person 
will say why this is utter BS.
<P>
Anyway, here's a list of REAL BBC 3 video titles about the <i>Things Not To Say</i> series...
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Anzp7gZhat0">Things not to say to very tall people</A>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOZRQJDwynM">Things Not To Say To 'Dangerous' Dog Owners (and dogs)</A>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAwl2VOKWew">Things you'll know if you still live with your parents</A>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i__fBb2oSUM">Things overweight people are tired of hearing</A>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34buf1e0OsA">Things not to say to people with ginger hair</A>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-6CBCGNzz8">Things Not To Say To Someone With Tattoos</A>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS0TvJeZ_Io">Things not to say to a single person</A>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxnCGEUcY0s">Things not to say to a sex worker</A>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68KWyisJ0tw">Things not to say to someone with afro hair</A>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnxVcJ4jSDw">Things not to say to people who don't drink</A>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i__fBb2oSUM">Things fat people are tired of hearing</A>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldOdodfBPug">Things That Vegans Are Tired of Hearing</A>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jT567d7T8Y">Things you'll know if you've been pregnant</A>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lBW4ZM2H1Y">Eight statements gamers are definitely tired of hearing</A>
</ul>
<P>
Also, <i>Things Not To Say To A Ginger Person</i>? What? 
The UK has the most ginger people in the world and if I 
recall correctly, Scotland is the home of the gingers... 
Well, that and Iron Brew...
<P>
The thing I don't like about the videos is that they are 
patronising; yes I know that is bad to make fun of people 
who are different, I know that - it's basic knowledge.
<P>

<P>
I honestly wouldn't be complaining if this wasn't made 
by the BBC, a company that everyone who watches TV in 
the UK needs to pay. So, if you watch TV in the UK, 
you're paying for this utter tripe!
