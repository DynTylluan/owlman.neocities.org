<font size="5"> <P>By Clive Python | 14jammar<font size="4"><P>
<TABLE WIDTH=750><TD VALIGN=TOP>
<tt>I will be talking about plot points in the movie, so spoilers.</tt>
<P>
Only 20's kids will remember 1922; what a time to be alive! While there were films made before 1922, none other 
was more ambitious than <i>H&auml;xan: Witchcraft Through the Ages</i>.



<P>
This was director Benjamin Christensen's third movie, with a budget 
costing nearly two million Swedish kronor it was the most expensive 
Scandinavian silent film ever made. The movie shows basic camera 
technics such as playing film backwards and overlaying film.
<P>
Due to the fact that the original copyright holder failed to 
renew its copyright, this now means that it is in the Public 
Domain - meaning that anyone can duplicate and sell copies of 
the film. Becuase of this, you should look it up online!
<P>
<i>H&auml;xan</i> is quite often than not overlooked by Nosferatu that came out in the same year. The movie is split into four parts;


<img src="https://owlman.neocities.org/library/img/haxan/hwcttacolour_14jammar.png" align=right hspace=15 vspace=5>
<P>
<h1>Part I</h1>
<P>
The first part of the movie starts off with showing a short history of demons 
and witches in primitive and medieval culture. The movie goes on and tells the 
viewer of what past cultures believed about the order of the world (i.e. God and the like).
<P>
<h1>Part II</h1>
<P>
Part II is really where the film starts to get crazy. The movie shows a sleeping woman 
who is soon tempted by Satan (played by the director) who soon makes the woman go away 
from her husband's bed and terrorises a group of monks.
<P>
<h1>Part III</h1>
<P>
A woman, who is thought to be a witch is put on trial and is tortured until she confesses her crimes.
<P>
<h1>Part IV</h1>
<P>

The last part of the movie is very interesting as it shows medieval methods of 
torture like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumbscrew_(torture)">the thumbscrew</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_ripper">The Breast Ripper</A> and other grizzly devices.


<P>
This is part of the movie that is most down to Earth, not only 
does it not deal with fantasy but it also goes out of its way 
to inform the viewer that one of the reasons why many women 
were mistaken for witches and then killed was because of 
ignorance such as religion.
<P>
An example of this would be that the movie tells of how nuns 
would use some torture devices on their self - such as a belt 
that had spikes on the inside to get closer to God.
<P>
<h1>Recuts</h1>
<P>
The movie has been heavily censored in some countries and even banned 
in The United States for what was considered at the time to be graphic 
depictions of torture, nudity (the most you see is a woman's bottom) 
and sexual acts. Compared to newer movies such as <i>Saw</i> and <i>The Human 
Centipede</i> the movie is very tame.
<P>
When the film was re-released in Demark in 1941, Benjamin Christensen 
considered removing the modern-day sequences from the film. Inevitably, 
the film was released with the modern scenes intact.
<P>

Despite how tame the movie is, in the UK the movie is still classed as an 18.
<P>
On a personal level, I think that <I>H&auml;xan</I> should be 
reclassified as 12A. The guidelines for a 12A movie are;
<P>
<tt><blockquote>
May contain mature themes, discrimination, soft drugs, 
moderate language, moderate violence, sex references and 
nudity. Sexual activity may be briefly and discreetly 
portrayed. Use of strong language may be permitted based on 
frequency and how they are used, as well as contextual 
justification. Sexual violence may be implied or briefly indicated.
</tt></blockquote>
<P>
What do you think? Should the movie be reclassified or should it stay an 18?
<P>
<h1>1968 Recut</h1>
in 1968 America, an abbreviated version of the film was released, called 
"Witchcraft Through the Ages". It was narrated by William S. Burroughs 
and had a horrible jazz score by Daniel Humair
<P>
The movie was cut from 104 minutes to 77 minutes. This version of the 
movie may (or may not) be public domain.
