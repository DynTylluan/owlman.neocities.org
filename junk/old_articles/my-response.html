    <h2>My response.</h2>
    <p>This is a response to Spriteclad's comment explaining that I'm Altro. I wont deny that it isn't true, but the fact that he throws Mebi <b>Shit</b>ios in there and that he made the fact sound like a bad thing brings my blood to a boil, well not really. But I have come here to clear things up.</p>
    <p>I am aware that the idea of Exan-eNet-Mebi-Saku-Vani-whatever was a copy of the Network Neighborhood. I was stupid and thought that because the NN was shutting down, that me and a few other people could make a carbon-copy of it.</p>
    <p>I just want to say, Mebi is dead. It was a mistake when it started, and I'm sorry that it had to exist. Hopefully you forgive me, or not. It's fine.</p>
