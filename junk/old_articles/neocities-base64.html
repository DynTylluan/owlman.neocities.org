    <h2>Getting around Neocities' restrictions.</h2>
	<p>If you know Neocities quite well, you're fully aware of whats happening. If you don't, let me explain.<br>
	<br>
	So Neocities has some file restrictions on what kinds of files you're able to put on your website, which sucks because you cant add music or videos to your website. The only kind of music you can add is simple MIDI files, but I found a way to get over that whitelist.<br>
	<br>
	There's this website that you can go to that can convert any file into Base64. Basically, <em>FILE to TEXT</em>. So you can drag a video or music file and turn it into text, which then you can use instead of a path to a file.<br>
	<br>
	<a href="https://thiscouldbebetter.neocities.org/filetodataurl.html">You can find it here</a>. So just throw in a file, copy and paste the file contents into the <em>src</em> and then <b>BAM!</b> You got around the file restrictions.<br>
	<br>
	You could just upgrade to supporter, but that costs money. If you're like me, you don't have any.<br>
