	<h2>School is the worst thing to come out of our society.</h2>
	<p>SCHOOL IS THE WORST THING TO COME OUT OF OUR SOCIETY. I LIKE LEARNING, I HATE SCHOOL. DON'T COME TO ME, SAYING THAT THEY'RE THE SAME, BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT EVEN RELATED. SCHOOL IS A BORING HELL STORM WHERE PEOPLE WHO ARENT PAYED JACK TRY TO TEACH YOU MATH WHILE YOU COULD BE LEARNING TO PAY TAX, OR ESTABLISH A COMPANY. WANT TO LEARN FIRST AID? NAH, LEARN WHO KILLED ABRAHAM LINCON BECAUSE "PEOPLE WHO DON'T LEARN HISTORY ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT". YEAH, SURE WHATEVER YOU SAY.</p>
