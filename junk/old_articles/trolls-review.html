    <h2>Trolls "2016"</h2>
	<p>"Trolls" is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. Its filled with a bunch of phrases that only edgy and retarded teens would say. For example:<br>
	<br>
	<span title="PLEASE DON'T.">"Lets get real for a second."</span><br>
	<span title="END THE SUFFERING.">"She's my plus one."</span><br>
	<span title="NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO.">"Yolo"</span><br>
	<br>
	That's as much as I could watch before I imploded from cringing so hard. They say classic movies will last forever, or something like that. Well, this movie will pretty much die in less than 10 years with the "lit lingo dat they be spouting xd". They screwed up. Also "The Emoji Movie" is a thing now, so we KNOW that god is dead.<br>
