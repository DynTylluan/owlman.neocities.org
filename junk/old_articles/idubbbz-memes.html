    <h2>iDubbbz Memes (unfinished)</h2>
    <p>Memes are a pretty common thing on the internet. If you say you haven't came across a meme on the internet, you're lying. These things are everywhere. From images to some <b>dank vine comps</b>. But there is one person that has made more memes then I can count (which is two) so I might as well cover some of the dank memes this god has created.</p><br>
    <h3>I'm Gay!</h3>
    <p>This gem was created during a production of Edward Watermelon hands, a skit with the "talented" minds of <em>Filthy Frank</em>, <em>MaxMoeFoe</em>, and of corse <em>idubbbz</em>. For Ian's part, he dressed up in the "Ian the Alien" or "Green Cunt" suit from other productions and sat on top of the microwave, above the oven where Frank was cooking food with "John Cena hands". Green Cunt then became horrified because Frank "killed John Santa". When the scene was over, Max thought it would be funny if Ian jumped off of the counter and said "some f<b>**</b>king gay s<b>**</b>t". Then, a meme was born.</p><br>
