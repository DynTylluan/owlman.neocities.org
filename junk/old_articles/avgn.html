    <h2>Why the AVGN sucks now.</h2>
    <p>Remember the “Angry Video Game Nerd”? He’s most known for the phrase “ASS!” and that’s about it. Well today, I’m going to talk about why the AVGN sucks dong now, so hand on to your hats.</p>
  <p>The AVGN has changed quite a bit, actually a lot. I would only recommend the videos before episode 100, because that’s before all the mess. Like unnecessary locations, green screening, and when most of the “anger” is put out of the episodes. It’s hard to not question him why he’s so calm playing SONIC ’06.</p>
  <p>Just recently, he made a video advertising a college. A FUCKING COLLEGE. What 12 year old wants to go to college? And yes, I just called his “fans” 12 year olds. That’s what they basically are, but that’s none of my business.</p>
  <p>The 16:9 aspect ratio is unnecessary. The games that he plays are all in the 4:3 aspect ratio, so why the hell would you make it widescreen? It’s the biggest waste of money the world’s ever seen. </p>
  <p>Also, a movie. There’s an AVGN Movie. ARE YOU SERIOUS? You should’ve made the movie in 2009, the only time that you were popular. I didn’t bother paying for the movie, so I watched it for free on some questionable website. The plot goes like this: company need promotion from avgn, company get avgn to talk about et Atari game. Explosions, conspiracy theories, and a bunch of other junk.</p>
  <p>In conclusion: Only watch the first 3.5 seasons of the AVGN, the only good seasons. That’s it. Good night.</p>
