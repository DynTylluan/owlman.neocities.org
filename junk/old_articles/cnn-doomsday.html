    <h2>CNN’s end of the world video.</h2>

    <p>CNN isn’t just known for being fake news <strike>I think</strike>, but did you know that CNN has a video that they would play on air when the end of the world comes? It was leaked some time ago, but today I’ll be looking at it and write down anything noteworthy.</p>
    
    <p>The video is basically a “US army band playing a mournful rendition of Nearer My God to Thee” according to theguardian.com, and they’re probably right so I’m not going to dig deeper.</p>
