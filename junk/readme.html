This is an archive of Design Choices' <a href="https://designchoices.neocities.org/junk/">/junk/</A> part of their site, as seen on the 27th of July 2017.
<P>
This page is here in case DC takes down his website (hopefully he does not), I did ask DC on Twitter if it was okay to make an archive of the /junk/ part.
<P><tt>
&lt;OwlMan>: So can I make an archive of Junk Box on my site?</br>
&lt;Design Choices>: Sure.</br>
&lt;Design Choices>: Fine with me.</br>
<P></tt>
Design Choices said that he would be taking his site down by the 3rd of August 2017, if the site is still up, then I will be removing this archive from my site.
