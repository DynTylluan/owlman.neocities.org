    <div dir="ltr"><div><div>Hello all, this is Jeremy here.<br><br></div>As you all probably now know, all Neocities sites default to HTTPS, i.e, unless you're using a very old browser that doesn't understand <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">HSTS</a>, it is now basically impossible to load your site over the (insecure) HTTP protocol.<br><br></div><div>Although this is probably a good thing in the long run, as <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.neocities.org/default-ssl.html">mentioned on the Neocities blog</a>, it will break some sites the way they're currently set up, <b>maybe even yours</b>.<br><br><i>However</i> -- Don't panic! I'm here to help&nbsp; :)<br><br></div><div>Step 1:<br><div style="margin-left:40px">Find and identify any resources (images, javascript, css, music, iframes, etc) loaded over http. Note that this also includes insecure links that open in frames.<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px"><br>Example: &lt;img src="<a href="http://example.com/exampl">http://example.com/exampl</a><wbr>e-image.jpg"&gt;<br><br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">Note that the most<b> </b>important changes you must make are to javascript, css, iframes, and "frame-links". Images and music will still sometimes be loaded over http, albeit often with a complaint from the browser.<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">However, browsers <b>WILL NOT</b> load any insecure javascript, css, or sites in iframes.<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">So focus your efforts there first!<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px"><br></div></div><div>Step 2:<br><div style="margin-left:40px"></div><div style="margin-left:40px"></div><div style="margin-left:40px">Anything hosted on another site that supports https, just change the protocol to either https, or "relative", which loads based on the protocol the page is being used over.<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">If it's another neocities site, this should be easy!<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px"><br>Example of https: &lt;img src="<a href="https://anlucas.neocities">https://anlucas.neocities</a><wbr>.org/worldwideweb_badge.gif"&gt;<br>Example of relative: &lt;img src="//<a href="http://anlucas.neocities.org/w">anlucas.neocities.org/w</a><wbr>orldwideweb_badge.gif"&gt;<br><br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">If the site doesn't support https, you can do a couple different things:<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px"><div style="margin-left:40px"><br></div></div><div style="margin-left:40px">If the resource is, for example, something that's intended to be shared, or in the public domain like a 88x31 button gif, you can probably safely download and re-host it on your site<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">Example before: &lt;img src="<a href="http://www.hat.net/abs/gi">http://www.hat.net/abs/gi</a><wbr>f/noclick.gif"&gt; <br>Example after: &lt;img src="/noclick.gif"&gt;<br><br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">If the resource is very large, or you don't think you're allowed to re-host it, like music or propriety javascript, then you can try saving/hosting it in the <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/web/">Internet Archive</a>, which supports https. Unfortunately, it also obeys <a target="_blank" href="http://www.robotstxt.org">robots.txt</a>, so this might not always work.<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">There are also a variety of music and other anonymous file hosting services, so trying googling around some too.<br><br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">Finally, if you have a link that opens in a frame that doesn't support https, just open it in a new tab! :)<br><br></div>Step 3:<br><div style="margin-left:40px">There is no no step three!<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">Congratulations, you're done! :D<br></div><div style="margin-left:40px">See, that wasn't that hard.<br></div><br></div><div>Please feel free to share this, I am releasing it under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</a>.<br></div><div><br>Thank you for reading!<br><br>
