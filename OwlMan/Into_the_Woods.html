One day me and my buddy, Barack Obama, were walking home after a fun day of pranking 
Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones.

"That sure was a fun day" said Barack to me
"It sure was" I said "It was fun messing with Mick"

The sky was as dark as a goth's eye liner; the stars, which just a few seconds ago were as bright 
as Einstein's intelligence, now dimmed and disappeared into oblivion, quicker than a X-Factor contestant.
