******************************************************************

"I can't do that!" said Peter Capaldi as he read the Doctor Who script, he was
unhappy since the BBC told him that swaring "Is not for the kidies"
"*Uhhh...* This is just silly, why the name of Chin-Chin does the Doctor
need to stop a evil duck?!!?"

Just then there was a knock at Peter's door, "Who the cow could that be?"

Peter walked to the door and opened it
"Ah, you must be Peter" said a purple pony "I've been waiting for you!"
"AHHH! HOLY SHIPS-OF-THE-SEE A TALKIN' PONY"

"*Uhh...* FTS..." Said the purple Pony, "I am Princess Twilight Sparkle.
And I am here to take you to Ponyvill, for the lulz"

By now Peters face was ghost white "Okay... Sure... Take me to Ponyland"

"-Vill" said Twilight "Okay, close your eyes and you will be in Ponyvill"

He did so.
"Now what?" He said

"I don't know" she said, "But I need foood"

"I'm hungey too" he said "I want a take-away"

And that was the story of when Peter Capaldi took acid.
