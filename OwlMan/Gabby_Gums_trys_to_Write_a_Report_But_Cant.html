About: The girls try and write about stuff...
********************************************************************************

The three fillyies sat by the typewriter trying to think of something to write for 
their school newspaper.
They had been sitting their for some time now and not one letter was typed on there
yet

"I have no ideas fo' what ta' write" said Apple Bloom

"Why don't we just make something up?" Scootaloo said

Suddenly Sweetie Belle (Who may I say is best CMC) said out of no where "01001001 
00100000 01110011 01101000 01101111 01110100 00100000 01001010 01000110 01001011"

"Well we can't put that in the paper!" said Scootaloo

"I know what I'll do" said Apple Bloom "I'll write somthin' about how Pinkie
Pie killed that guy last week"

"01010010 01001001 01010000 00100000 01000011 01101000 01101001 01101110 
00101101 01000011 01101000 01101001 01101110" said Sweetie Belle

"I know THERE was blood everywhere" Scootaloo replied
***

The girls soon started to write down their article on how Pinkie Pie killed the Dark Lord 
in cold blood; The night soon turned into the day when the girls submitted their work to 
the school newspaper, the girls were really proud of what they wrote
***

Sadly for the girls Pinkie Pie's lawyer was not too happy about what they wrote about 
her, so the girls soon got their arse sued
