c. 1961
Recorded by: Achille and Giovanni Battista Judica-Cordiglia
Lost Cosmonauts, or Phantom Cosmonauts, is a conspiracy theory alleging that Soviet 
cosmonauts entered outer space, but without their existence having been acknowledged by either the 
Soviet or Russian space authorities. Proponents of the Lost Cosmonauts hypothesis concede that Yuri Gagarin 
was the first man to survive human spaceflight, but claim that the Soviet Union attempted to launch two or 
more manned space flights prior to Gagarin's, and that at least two cosmonauts died in the attempts. 
Another cosmonaut, Vladimir Ilyushin, is believed to have landed off-course and been held 
by the Chinese government. The Government of the Soviet Union supposedly suppressed 
this information, to prevent bad publicity during the height of the Cold War. The evidence cited to 
support Lost Cosmonaut theories is generally not regarded as conclusive, and several cases have been 
confirmed as hoaxes. In the 1980s, American journalist James Oberg researched space-related disasters 
in the Soviet Union, but found no evidence of these Lost Cosmonauts. 
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, much previously restricted information 
is now available, including on Valentin Bondarenko, a would-be cosmonaut whose death during training on 
Earth was covered up by the Soviet government. Even with the availability of published Soviet archival 
material and memoirs of Russian space pioneers, no hard evidence has emerged 
to support the Lost Cosmonaut stories.
