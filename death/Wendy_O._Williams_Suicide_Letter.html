**************************************************************************************************************

The act of taking my own life is not something that I do without a lot of thought. 
I don't believe that people should take their own lives without deep and thoughtful reflection 
over a considerable period of time. 
I do believe strongly, however, that the right to do so is one of the most fundamental rights anyone in a free 
society should have. For me much of the world makes no sense, but my feelings about what I am doing ring loud 
and clear to an inner ear and to a place where there is no self, only calm. 

Love always, Wendy.
