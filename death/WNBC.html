1st of October 1947 – 22nd of October 1986
She was 39 at the time of her death

At 4:44 p.m. 22/Oct/86 Jane Dornacker was in a Enstrom F-28 helicopter, that plunged into the 
Hudson River from an altitude of roughly 75 feet (23 m). On her final radio broadcast she was giving a 
report of an accident involving a tractor-trailer and a car as well as a car fire. 
She also stated that the outbound Holland Tunnel was heavy with traffic and that the 
Lincoln Tunnel was much better. Dornacker was starting her report for incoming New Jersey traffic when 
the helicopter suffered mechanical failure in mid broadcast and crashed.

Joey Reynolds: O.K., here's Jane Dornacker now in the N-copter.

Jane Dornacker: Thank you very much, Joey.
There was indeed an accident southbound on the Major Deegan at the Mosholu Parkway, an accident, a serious 
accident involving a tractor trailer and a car. It has been pushed off to the shoulder but now watch out there 
now because another flatbed truck is gonna have to come to clear it so yield right of way. Northbound on the 
B.Q.E., we've spotted that disabled vehicle in the right-hand lane before the Kosciuszko, not causing much 
of a backup. But further north down there on the B.Q.E. traffic is very heavy past the Kosciuzko all the way 
over to the L.I.E. The outbound Holland Tunnel extra heavy for you right now. 
Earlier there was a car fire at Hudson and Canal Street. 
It has been cleared of that, uh. 
Heading to New Jersey, the outbound Lincoln Tunnel looks a lot better for you. 
In New Jersey [Pause] Hit the water, hit the water, hit the water 
[Sound of a crash, then static followed by five seconds of dead air.] 

Joey Reynolds: O.K., we're going to play some music here, I think. 
Find out what's going on with the helicopter. 
Something happened there. 
It's a quarter of 5, 16 till 5 on WNBC, on the Joey Reynolds Show, checking an N-copter 
report from Jane Dornacker. We'll check in, see how they're doing here and then we'll come right back at you.

Reynolds: I hope nothing happened with Jane. 
We had, uh, a helicopter report, from the N-Copter. 
Of course, you know, once before, we had this happen. 
A few months ago, she went down in the, uh, in the drink. Not she, I mean, she has a... pilot. 
Jane is, uh...

Other voice: Well, until we find out what's going on, we'll just...

Reynolds: Jane was up there just now giving us a report, and sometimes it just gets cut off, too, you know. 
It's just an electronic thing. 
But, uh, this time she said, uh, "hit the water," or something like that. 
So we're going to find out what's going on there, so stay tuned. 
We hope nothing... say a little prayer, hope nothing's, nothing's wrong. 
That's really a... [deep breath] that's a hard, hard job.
