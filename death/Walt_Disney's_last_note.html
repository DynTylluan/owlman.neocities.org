5th of December 1901 – 15th of December 1966
He was 65 at the time of his death
Disney diad of Lung cancer

It's not really known why Disney wrote "Kurt Russell" - One could only guess that he wanted the child
actor (who was signed to the studio at the time) to be in a movie. 
On an appearance on "Jimmy Kimmel Live", Kurt Russell confirmed the urban legend to be true. 
"It's true. I don't know what to make of that. I was taken into his office one time after he 
died and I was shown that."
