**************************************************************************************************************

Dearest, I feel certain that I'm going mad again. 
I feel we can't go through another of those terrible times. 
And I shan't recover this time. 
I begin to hear voices, and I can't concentrate. 
So I am doing what seems to be the best thing to do. 
You have given me the greatest possible happiness. 
You have been in every way all that anyone could be. 
I don't think two people could have been happier until this terrible disease came. 
I can't fight it any longer. I know that I am spoiling your life, that without me you could work. 
And you will I know. 
You see I can't even write this properly. 
I can't read. 
What I want to say is I owe all the happiness in my life to you. 
You have been entirely patient with me and incredibly good. 
I want to say that everybody knows it. 
If anybody could have saved me it would have been you. 
Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness. 
I can't go on spoiling you life any longer. 
I don't think two people could have been happier than we have been.
