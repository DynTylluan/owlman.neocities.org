11th of September 1997
A man claiming to have worked at Area 51 called in to Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell. 
He spoke with the frenzied voice of a man terrified for his life, describing "extra-dimensional"
beings and plots by the government that would drastically, and horrifically, change our world.

Seven months later, on 28th of April 1998, Art Bell received another call, purportedly by the same man. 
This time, however, he claimed the initial call was a hoax. 
Ever since, there's been a lot of debate surrounding these calls. 
Was the first call real? 
Or had it truly been someone testing out "wacky characters" on the Coast to 
Coast AM audience, as the second caller claimed?
