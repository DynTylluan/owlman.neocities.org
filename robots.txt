# Hello if you're a human! Here is the robots.txt file for owlman.neocities.org
# If you don't know what this is, the tl;dr is that it tells web crawlers 
# and other web robots what they can and can not view/index.

# For my robots.txt I am telling all crawlers that they can't view 
# Who is Who in ASCII Art and a robots.txt example that I used on this page:
# https://owlman.neocities.org/library/archive.html

# You can see that I have also told a crawler by the name of ia_archiver that
# they can view all of the site bar the robots.txt example.
# The ia_archiver is a bot from The Internet Archive, 
# a 501(c)(3) non-profit library I hold very dear to my heart.

# If you have any questions about what robots.txt are, I would view the websites
# listed to help you better understand
